Why, you might ask, am I trying this again?  I&apos;ve had two false starts, you might add, and it seems pretty clear at this point that I lack the self-discipline and pure self-interest necessary for such an endeavour.  You might end your question by expanding the scope of your incredulity and pointing out that I never finish anything I start, and that I&apos;m generally a worthless and lazy bum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ve got some attitude, don&apos;t you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to the question that started that unfiltered torrent of vitriol is actually quite simple; I&apos;m starting this project once again, despite my obvious inability to complete it, because I&apos;m a very silly person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence has long supported this conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I sit, silly, in a relatively comfortable chair facing out a window in Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.  Yes, that&apos;s actually the name - it doesn&apos;t quite roll off the tongue, does it.  The time is 5:36 AM EST, which is 2:36 AM PST.  I give the Pacific time for point of comparison; I awoke yesterday morning at seven AM in San Francisco, and I have no yet slept.  My sleep-addled mind calculates this as nineteen and a half hours without sleep; as is always the case - and doubly so in this state - my math is worth checking.  But the end result of my rambling is fairly clear: It is late, and I am tired.  My state of mind is most accurately described as &apos;absent&apos;, and I&apos;ve miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Though, as if to quash any poetical leanings I might have, there are no woods in sight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ve dodged that bullet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I come to be in this chronologically-intense fatiguing mess?  MacWorld San Francisco is to blame; that and my retrospectively hilarious decision to take the red-eye flight home Friday night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am, as has been mentioned previously, a very silly person.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

The post below was actually written in the Atlanta airport (as it says... are you calling the post below a liar?) during my arduous and extended trip home from MacWorld.  I&apos;ve taken the liberty of inserting the week-old post into the brand-new page.  It feels like I&apos;m cheating, but I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MacWorld was, as always, an experience.  There are a number of groups or classifications to which I belong that are occasionally sources of discomfort; I&apos;m proud to be a Mac user, but some Mac users are just so frelling &lt;i&gt;nuts&lt;/i&gt; that I&apos;m embarrassed to count myself among their numbers.  I often feel that way about watching &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Buffy&lt;/i&gt;, as long as I&apos;m on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do people feel the need to turn an interest into an obsession?  Why do some of them push obsession to the brink of religion?  Why can&apos;t I ever write a sequence of quasi-rhetorical questions without ending in a lame joke?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need more of a background in psychology.  People just don&apos;t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='4' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2003://1.4' author_id='1' authored_on='20030117121000' basename='when_you_dream' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233134' modified_on='20080324233134' ping_count='0' status='2' title='When You Dream' week_number='200303'><text>&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s hard to be meaningful in a word processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can sit and think and come up with words and phrases that I think are absolutely beautiful, but the moment I lay my hands upon a keyboard it all evaporates.  I&apos;m not good with words - I can arrange them well enough, but I can never really say what I want to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreams fascinate me; not the events of dreams, but the concept of dreaming itself.  I take it on faith that I must dream, but I can&apos;t recall ever remembering one.  Instead I occasionally have sleepy imaginings, typically just as I&apos;m falling to sleep or as I&apos;m trying to get up in the morning.  It&apos;s difficult to explain them.  They bear a certain resemblance to what I&apos;ve read of lucid dreams, but they still have a rigid enough adherence to the laws of reality that I don&apos;t think they&apos;re dreaming in the conventional sense.  But then again, I&apos;m not an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring the subject up because I had one of these near-dreams last night that disturbed me greatly, and I feel like I need to get the damn thing out of my system before I choke on it.  Is that what diaries/journals/logs are for?  I hope so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dream was essentially of the death of my Mother.  It&apos;s a difficult concept for me to wrap my head around; I&apos;ve always been something of a &quot;momma&apos;s boy&quot;.  I know intellectually that everyone dies, but I still can&apos;t accept the possibility of a world without the people I love.  Words are failing me, so I&apos;ll resort to a witless analogy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that my arms are attached to my torso by tendons and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that if my arms were pulled with sufficient force in opposite directions, this attachment would come to an unceremonious conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I still believe that there&apos;s no way that could ever happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not often that I know I&apos;m being stupid but I can&apos;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

The area code was 612, which isn&apos;t one I recognized.  I decided there was a definite possibility that it was my boss calling from Atlanta, and elected to let it ring.  Whoever the caller was, he or she decided not to leave a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that 612 is the area code for Minneapolis, Minnesota.  So now I&apos;m stuck with the question: who the hell do I know in Minnesota?  I&apos;m pretty sure I don&apos;t know anybody.  It&apos;s a tough one.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

This isn&apos;t surprising or unusual in and of itself; Dilbert is often funny.  What&apos;s particularly notable about today&apos;s strip is that it seems to be about someone I work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2003-01-18/&quot; title=&quot;Dilbert.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/000000/00000/0000/000/18/18.strip.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Dilbert.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s supposed to be warm and sunny, with cloud-free skies and a bright outlook.  I shouldn&apos;t need to bundle up just to sit at my computer with the fan off and the window shut.  This is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNL is funny again this week.  I wonder if there&apos;s some kind of a complex numeric pattern governing that, like how the Star Trek movies used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupid &apos;Nemesis&apos;, killing off a good pattern.  Grr.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Eventually it slips out accidentally or is revealed by a third party, and the tension ends and everyone&apos;s happy.  It&apos;s a recognizable archetype to which everyone can relate, and it&apos;s the kind of thing that can be made to fit nicely into a half hour show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real life it&apos;s not so simple; there&apos;s always the question, does anyone else think this but me?  And nobody wants to be the first to say anything, because all too often the agreement was a fantasy, pure imagination.  Why can&apos;t real life be more like television?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem is patterns.  I see them, even when they&apos;re not there.  I&apos;m not quite at &lt;i&gt;A Beautiful Mind&lt;/i&gt; level, but I&apos;m close enough to see where it comes from.  And, like the fictionalized Nash, all too often the patterns are entirely in my head; I want to see connections, I want to assume that if B follow A then A caused B.  It&apos;s hard.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

And I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not quite sure how I feel about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck by an odd thought this morning.  The Chinese food place at the mall has a rather grotesque name: Panda Express.  Think about it; they don&apos;t serve pandas... &lt;i&gt;Or do they?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In local news, I think I&apos;ve figured out how Phoenix disk encryption could work without a custom partition map driver.  It would have some advantages and disadvantages compared to my current plan, so I&apos;ll need to think more about it.  Not having to replace/reimplement IOApplePartitionScheme would be a nice escape and would definitely be to Apple&apos;s preference, but it would leave me at their mercy for respecting the automount bit.  I&apos;m not sure which is more important to me.  If I worked at a real company I&apos;d probably ask my boss or the marketoids to make the decision, but I honestly don&apos;t have the patience to explain the question to them.  Maybe I&apos;ll just flip a coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to check the priority queue, actually.  Is Phoenix more important than Inferno?&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Bloody El Gato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uality issue is coming up again with respect to outgoing products.  T__ is really fuming, and he&apos;s reminding me of how I used to care about these things.  I&apos;m wondering what sort of mental adjustments would be required for me to sell out.  It seems like the thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Suddenly, I stop, look down at what I&apos;ve written, and gasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not what I&apos;ve written; it&apos;s how I&apos;ve written it.  I&apos;m looking down at a perfect replica of Dad&apos;s handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if it weren&apos;t bad enough that I sound like him on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, further experimentation seems to indicate it may be a fluke; I&apos;m unable to consciously emulate his penmanship.  It seems to be something that I&apos;m only able to do when I&apos;m not fully paying attention&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of intelligent storage devices, a new unholy alliance has taken form; this time it&apos;s Engineering and Tech Support, rather than QA and Marketing.  Still rather unholy, though.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;&gt;But I have an excuse!  My computer finally got delivered today, after being stuck in shipping purgatory for over a week.  Damned marketoids couldn&apos;t seem to understand that those of us who do &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;computers&lt;/i&gt; need to &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; their &lt;i&gt;computer&lt;/i&gt; to do &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt;.  Frelling morons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, I&apos;m back to something approaching a workable work environment, all things considered.  Was busy all day, setting my system back up and verifying that everything arrived in the appropriate number of pieces.  Had time to do some more testing with FirePower, and it looks like my initial dismay/shock/fear wasn&apos;t entirely founded; although a FirePower on the S800 card has slower writes than a PrinceDrive on the internal S400, it&apos;s still faster than a PrinceDrive on the S800 card.  Conclusion seems to be that the S800 card or the PCI bus (or even the S800 OHCI drivers?) is at fault, rather than the OXUF922.  Which is good, &apos;cause that firmware is &lt;i&gt;messy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

I think it&apos;s okay for me to arbitrarily decide that I don&apos;t much like people who use Opera or iCab though, so I&apos;m not going to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve got enough to worry about today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have sitting on my desk a second generation Universal Media Reader, exhibiting a bug that was supposed to be fixed in the second generation.  This is of course after finding out a few days back that every single one of the second generation units had a new and exciting bug.  This product will be the death of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random thought for the day: why do I bother?  I&apos;ve always believed that everything in life is an exercise in optimization, and that it&apos;s simply a matter of making sure what you&apos;re optimizing.  I used to think I was ahead of the game, because I was optimizing happiness while others were optimizing money.  I wonder if I&apos;m doing that anymore.  I&apos;m certainly not jumping-up-and-down happy living in intelligent storage land, but then I wasn&apos;t happy doing nothing either.  I guess I need to either adjust my world view or figure out under what circumstance I would be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that wasn&apos;t very random, was it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly more random thought for the day: Why the hell would anybody use a TiVo to watch the Super Bowl?  The commercials are at least half the fun!&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;The UMR bug has been offically attributed to gremlins.  We can&apos;t reproduce it, and we can&apos;t be more than 99.9% certain that it was actually an issue, so we&apos;re going to ignore it until it comes back and bites us on the ass.  Aren&apos;t we smart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&apos;m going to suggest adding a special section to the user guides for all our products, advising users not to expose them to water, not to expose them to the sun or bright lights (it can kill them!) and most importantly of all, to never, &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; feed them after midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that&apos;ll go over real well.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

We&apos;ve been over this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boss leaves (with his boss, I think) for the fruit company tomorrow.  Hopefully my pretty graphs will convince them of our dire need for new toys.  Yeah, fat chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve suggested that we release Hephaistos as freeware, and leave the source ajar.  I anticipate legalistic objections, at which point I&apos;ll ask permission to distribute it on its own - so in a few weeks there might actually be something on this site.  Scary, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice benefit to Hephaistos is that I&apos;ve laid enough of the ground work for Phoenix to be fairly easy.  In fact, if the cat people ever cough up the existing 10.1 code, I could probably have a full Jaguar-friendly version of Phoenix inside of a month.  Assuming, of course, that no emergencies intercede.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rover is having troubles again; the latest firmware (version 3? 4?) fixes some of the bugs from the last rev, but now automatically advancing to the next track isn&apos;t always working.  It seems to be specific to some tracks, but not specific to any files.  I&apos;m wondering if the famous W95 long file name FAT entry spoof is at fault.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

There&apos;s just that much to it.  It may turn out in a week that I hate it, but early returns have it showing as the best film I&apos;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s rare for me to see a movie and identify with a character; I&apos;m just odd that way.  I usually end up feeling for the villain, which I guess lends some credence to the opinion the rest of humanity has of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;Adaptation&lt;/i&gt; was different; I don&apos;t identify with Cage&apos;s character, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; Cage&apos;s character.  I&apos;m also the brother, and LaRoche, and the woman writer.  It&apos;s a heady experience, being the entire cast.  But it leaves the same difficult question I always end up with: does anybody else see this the same way I do?  Do other folks love it for completely orthoganol reason, because they look at the characters and say, &quot;hey, I know a loser just like that guy!&quot;...  I wish I could just pick something and beleive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still.  &lt;i&gt;You are what you love, not what loves you.&lt;/i&gt;  It&apos;s hard to believe; not hard in that the premise is difficult to understand or even unbelievable, but hard because it requires effort to believe it.  Faith, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s never been a strong point of mine.  Which I guess ties nicely back into paragraph two, sentence two.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;The government is dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRMS was dysfunctional.  CSN was dysfunctional.  CMU was unbearably dysfunctional.  SmartDisk was entertainingly dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FGUC is also dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Monday at 6:30 I take a call called &apos;Introduction to Business&apos;.  Although I find the class itself conceptually appealing, I&apos;m amused and dismayed to find that the teacher is the sort who basically stands in front of the class and reads from the text for the entire time.  Furthermore, when she&apos;s not reading from the  text, she&apos;s showing us the PowerPoint slides that came with the text, or the movies that came with the text, or mentioning the CD and web site that accompany the text.  And to make matters worse, the text itself is a tech-bubble anachronism, filled with jeering about how the internet will change &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.  There are actually sidebars talking about wonderful new dotcom companies that in this modern &lt;i&gt;world of the future&lt;/i&gt; no longer exist.

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a thinker.  Money?  Power?  Women?  I&apos;d like to think I could get those on my own, if properly motivated.  I&apos;m forced to the conclusion that the only things worth wishing for are things that can&apos;t be obtained through non-supernatural means.&lt;/p&gt;

The backstory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kerwin family has three cellphones with AT&amp;amp;T Wireless.  The phones and the accompanying service was originally purchase from CellularOne, which (in this area at least) was purchased by AT&amp;amp;T.  As a result, we have a calling plan that no longer exists, with phones that are no longer supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve been looking to upgrade our service, but we don&apos;t want to change our phone numbers, so (for the moment at least) we need to stay with AT&amp;amp;T.  Because of problems with our voicemail service that I&apos;m led to believe are endemic to AT&amp;amp;T&apos;s TDMA cell network, we were also planning to switch to their GSM network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they won&apos;t let us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would increase our monthly bills by a not-insubstantial amount, and would require a fairly significant one-time outlay for the handsets, but they stubbornly refuse to budge one bit in helping us.  It makes me wonder how this blasted company stays in business.  Every time we&apos;ve interacted with AT&amp;amp;T in any way we&apos;ve been disappointed; the woman at the local AT&amp;amp;T Wireless store has lied to us, the website goes up and down like a bloody yo-yo, the phone support personnel vary from clueless to downright malevolent.

I beleive I&apos;ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; doing name-based virtual hosting now, which means that I could in theory generate a plethora of subdomains to hamstergeddon.dyndns.org.  Such as, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://domeign.hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/&quot;&gt;domeign.hamstergeddon.dyndns.org&lt;/a&gt;, which will someday be the home of my longest-running project ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domeign is my working title for an online game I&apos;ve been working on, on-and-off, for nearly five years now.  The (current) basic gist of the project is that it&apos;s a highly distributed multi-user online environment, geared towards simulating a complex world based on several basic first prinicples.  Specifically, instead of having explicit code for creating an in-game object, the object would be created by other in-game objects and would basically represent a chunk of raw code that the game&apos;s virtual machine would execute according to the &apos;laws&apos; of the game world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m simplifying things a bit in this explanation, but I think anyone with much programming knowledge will probably see what I&apos;m getting at.  Obviously the big challenge here is in defining a virtual machine within which any arbitrary chunk of data can be treated as a program and executed without fatal errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&apos;m getting there, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Which is cool, no doubt, but it&apos;s another search engine that I&apos;ll need to convince of my supremity among Sean Kerwins.  Unfortunately, it&apos;s not working properly at the moment (probably has something to do with &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/23/1415235&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=95&quot;&gt;making the front page&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org&quot;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;) so I can&apos;t see what it thinks of me.  I suspect not much, however, as there&apos;s no explicit mention of my location anywhere on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the term &apos;geek&apos; in reference to myself fairly regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve noticed that we, as a stereotype, have difficulties establishing communication.  Once you know that both parties are geeks (and that they are geekish in similar fields) they can transfer information at a truly remarkable pace.  But knowing this is never easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand how IP networking works.  Better than a great many professional sysadmins, I&apos;d imagine.  But trying to convince another geekish human being that I&apos;m able to handle these matters on my own is proving to be a bit of a sticking point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well.  I&apos;ll just use the standard Sean system.  Ignore everybody else, do it right, and hope they don&apos;t ask any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backup plan: If they ask questions, distract them with something brightly colored or shiny, and then run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backup backup plan: Two words... &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icecreamusa.com/klondike/&quot;&gt;Klondike Bar&lt;/a&gt;.  I&apos;m not sure how this plan works, but I have a good feeling about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But specifically, right now, for the moment, I hate non-English speakers who post to English mailing lists with no formatting, punctuation, or capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re from one of those weird far-eastern places where the alphabet is longer than many novels, fine, maybe you have an excuse.  But if you&apos;re French, you get no-freaking-sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French has capital letters at the start of a sentence.  French has comma rules that are largely in line with English.  French has a logical structure that lends itself to separating thoughts into different paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for German, for that matter.  And Italian.  Spanish too.  Basically any language they speak in Europe, as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swear to God, the next time some French moron posts to the Darwin-Dev mailing list with a nonsensical string of un-capitalized, un-punctuated letters, I&apos;m going to track that fuckwit down and bury him up to his neck in sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image my surprise at being introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacortechs.com/&quot;&gt;Metacortechs.com&lt;/a&gt;.  And, of course, a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.underscorehosting.com/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paranormaljournal.org/&quot;&gt;very&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.little-boxes.net/&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metadex.net/&quot;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those keeping score at home, Elizabeth McConnell seems to be walking the same path as a certain Mr. Anderson, and Phillip Gairden seems to be encouraging her.  Steven Walsh is just a little bit scary, perhaps because of the somewhat odd disappearance of former CEO (?) James Avery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beth doesn&apos;t have a very secret password for her MetaDex account, but she doesn&apos;t seem to use the same one everywhere.  Damn.  On the up side, Underscore doesn&apos;t have a terribly impressive security system... working on that as we speak, it&apos;s only a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly, MetaDex.net seems to have ports open for Napster and Gnutella, which seems like something worth looking at more closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this information is entirely useless, as my IP isn&apos;t acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New working theory: doing some portscans, it appears that some of these sites have telnet/ssh enabled.  Perhaps with appropriate credentials, such as those of the elusive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metadex.net/usr/emc2/bio/&quot;&gt;Beth&lt;/a&gt;, we might obtain shell access to a machine that &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have an acceptable IP, and might then use telnet or lynx from there to retrieve useful information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m wondering if there actually is a puzzle here.  It seems inconceivable that someone would dig a rabbit hole quite this deep...&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

We just played.  I just beat him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a rather odd occurrence, and not one that will likely be soon repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s consistently better than I at StarCraft.  Always was.  First-person shooters, too.  I just don&apos;t have the reflexes to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a week or so, once he&apos;s got the hang of W3, he&apos;ll be schooling me without breaking a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss Warcraft 2.  The game was slow, slow to the point where it became boring at times, but as a result it was a much different game.  In StarCraft or Warcraft 3, manual dexterity plays a large and central role - being able to micro-manage your units and buildings allow you to produce more productively, and thus crush your opponent more... crushingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warcraft 2 had much less frantic clicking involved, and as a result there was more room for strategy.  I would routinely kill Monkey Boy, often by sailing around him and building a camp right behind his main town.  It was funny, and it was fun, and it was possible because the management aspects of the game were sufficiently simplistic that I could devote the majority of my efforts to strategic planning and troop movements, rather than making sure my peons were chopping down trees appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll say it again: I miss Warcraft 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways it&apos;s similar to the argument I had with Chum on CSMGA about the Clan Lord user interface several years back; my position is that the game should be modified to counteract the failings of the human-computer interface.  His position was that those failings are a part of the game, and are an intentional attempt at increasing the difficulty.  He&apos;s still wrong.  Clan Lord doesn&apos;t want to be Quake, it wants to be chess.  So does Warcraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you really think that me being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles, in this place?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Tetris is also fairly easy for quite a few humans.  Stay with me, here.  If you have a convenient algorithm for solving an NP-complete problem, it&apos;s trivial (for folks who know how) to convert this algorithm to solve any NP-complete problem.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this image of a room full of kids, sitting at terminals, playing Tetris, unaware that the game they&apos;re playing is a translation of another NP-complete process entirely.  Think of the game room from Ender&apos;s game, but they&apos;re all actually playing Tetris, never knowing that they&apos;re winning a galactic war or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is either really cool or really dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

It just seem lately that whenever I find myself engaged in introspection I come up with nothing; my attempts at reflection are thwarted by the fact that there&apos;s not all that much to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&apos;m a no-frills sort of person; I don&apos;t feel all that much all that often.  I sometimes fool myself that I&apos;m just the proverbial still waters running deep, but on some level I know that&apos;s not true.  I experience affection in the same way Data does; &quot;As I experience certain sensory input patterns, my mental pathways become accustomed to them.  The inputs are eventually anticipated and even missed when absent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of course leads me back to the one question that haunts me day and night; does this make me a bad person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d like to argue that the simple fact that I worry about this amounts to an answer in the negative, but that also feels like self delusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I&apos;m on the subject, why do I even care whether I&apos;m good or evil when I don&apos;t believe in Heaven or Hell?&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

I usually take these tests when they&apos;re not too long and seem somewhat interesting, but this is the first time the results have amused me quite this much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this post is, of course, an obscure Buffy reference.  I feel compelled to state this explicitly because I know of only one other person on Earth who would get the joke otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to regrow life from the dead.  But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian).  The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire.  Her sign is the eclipsed moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual.  You may be a little idealistic, but you are very grounded and down to earth.  You realize that not everything lasts, but you savor every minute of the good times.  While you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you have strong ties with people that will never be broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have because they are sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can use my iPod in my car now.  It&apos;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a cassette adapter in my poor old smooshed Saturn, so I used my iPod with a cassette deck adapter in there.  My new (not so terribly new anymore, actually) Civic has only a CD player and radio, however, so the old solution was out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I&apos;m morally opposed to broadcasting on FM and using that particular hack (in no small part because of experiences with this technology back when I was living in Intelligent-Storage-Land), I decided to go with a thoroughly nerdy solution; I took apart my dashboard, hooked up a an adapter, and now my stereo deck think my iPod is a standard Honda 6-disc CD changer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is a suboptimal solution; the Belkin TuneDok (&lt;b&gt;hate&lt;/b&gt; that name) is cheesy, despite being the least-cheesy solution available.  Some day some car company will have the foresight to build an iPod dock right into the car, with automatic interfacing to the stereo.  Or perhaps some kind of a general purpose area into which a wide variety of docking stations could be seemlessly inserted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should patent that.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to figure out how to overwrite other systems.  The world could do with a few more of me.  Or at least, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&apos;m going to be honest with you.  I hate this place.  This zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it, I can&apos;t stand it any longer. It&apos;s the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it.

&lt;p&gt;Ares being, of course, the server hosting this site.  I always name all my machines (hey, it beats memorizing IP addresses) and I try to keep a theme going.  Sometimes I take it a bit too far, I suspect.  I&apos;ve got Ares running the webserver.  My main machine is Thanatos, with an internal ATA RAID-1 for storing my multimedia by the name of Clio.  My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonyericsson.com/t616/overview/&quot;&gt;nifty phone&lt;/a&gt;, which I love like a brother, shows up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/isync/&quot;&gt;iSync&lt;/a&gt; as Terpsichore.  My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipod/&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; is named Iris (not iRis, though that would be funny), and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; library shows up as Euterpe to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/rendezvous/&quot;&gt;other folks on the network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend started way-back in IntelligentStorageLand, of course, with Prometheus, Hephaistos, and the oft-threatened-but-never-written Sisyphus.  For those joining the party late, Prometheus was (is!) used at the factory to create FireWire hard disks, Hephaistos was built to help in developing nifty new FireWire hard disks, and Sisyphus would have been a burn-in program - something that continually wrote data to a disk forever, never really accomplishing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six people sufficiently versed in Greek mythology to understand all that and find it entertaining are cracking up right now, I know it.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

They always sound so great while I&apos;m doing it, and I don&apos;t doubt that further reflection would yield an appraisal of at least &apos;good&apos;.  The problem is that these brilliant ramblings somehow evaporate from my mind the moment I&apos;m within arm&apos;s reach of some way to transcribe them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m left wondering if perhaps brilliance is an inherently transient phenomenon, if the only reason I&apos;m having these thoughts is that there&apos;s no way to record them.  Perhaps everyone is granted occasional flashes of insight, only to lose them an instant later.  Maybe genius is simply the ability to recall these epiphanies at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want an application that launches automatically at startup and then just sits there, waiting for something interesting to happen.  When something happens, I want it to tell me; if something&apos;s important and I&apos;m not at my computer, I want it to SMS my cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I define &apos;something interesting&apos;?  Email from my parents... major news events... catastrophic hardware failure...  The list goes on.  But the notification method should reflect the importance of the event - a new post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org&quot;&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt; should be an unobtrusive green sphere on my screen, while a terrorist attack should fill the screen, beep, and buzz my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are things that are kind-a like this already, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp&quot;&gt;iPulse&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/5da2/&quot;&gt;the Ambient Orb&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing exactly like what I want.  iPulse will always show up on your desktop, even when everything&apos;s going fine, and it doesn&apos;t watch the world outside.  The Orb can never grab your attention the way I&apos;d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far too much flying, far too much driving, far too much getting-up-early.  But fun nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve decided that I need to update the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/lovejoy/football.html&quot;&gt;Family Football page&lt;/a&gt; - Owen hasn&apos;t updated lately, and I suspect with the two little ones he hasn&apos;t got the time.&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s rather confusing to realize that I think I might actually miss it.  It&apos;s a dumb class, don&apos;t get me wrong, but it was nice to have an open venue for argument once a week.  Brings back fond memories of CSN English classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last meeting of stupid-idiotic-dumb-business class was last night, but I&apos;ve still got the final left for that.  I can&apos;t wait for this semester to end, but then again, I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; wait for next semester to start.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently they&apos;re firing all adjuncts for next semester.  It&apos;s distressing that at least one decent teacher will be thrown out with the bathwater, but in a more general sense it&apos;s probably a good thing, all things considered.  Dad will do a happy-dance, at any rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domeign is continuing to solidify in my mind.  All objects are enclosed another object, all Philotes have a parent Philote... Except of course for the architects, who encloses himself and is his own parent.  I think.  It&apos;s complicated.  I suppose I&apos;ll just make traversing the hierarchy a prohibitive energy drain, and hope nobody probes the universe quite so deeply.  Either way, I think I can make all the neat things I want to make; body tranplants, trained pets, evolving animals, Smiths, Fanan&apos;s Automated Region of Trouble, little bald doctors, Roland, Frodo...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only major open question I have at this point is synthesis and decay.  There obviously needs to be a way to create an object from constituient elements, but where do you get the blueprints?  My current idea is an (Aristotelian?  Platonic?  Who was that?) aether in which the ideal forms of all objects exist, which can then be probed, indexed, and if the wizard in question is sufficiently skilled, memorized.  I like this idea because it allows me to quote Greek philosophers in explaining it, but I&apos;m still working out the details of how exactly it could work.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

They sleep through classes.  They buy books and don&apos;t read them, fail tests, and learn nothing.  The only sleep they get is after passing out.  They drink anything that might cause brain damage.  They smoke anything flammable.  Their lungs look like a charcoal grill.  They are infested with a variety of transmissible diseases.  They never quit bitching.  They are dangerously codependent.  They don&apos;t know when a joke has gone too far.  They take and they take and they take without giving, but nobody minds because nobody&apos;s paying any attention.  They romanticize their childhood as an escape mechanism.  Eventually they drink enough that they forget even this.  They labor under the false impression that they were once human.  They are now walking through an entirely new meat grinder while building the same old wall, and they think they&apos;re someplace new.  They are collectively deceived into thinking that this is the way of things, and their herd mentality keeps them in check.  They hasten death.  They eat crap, often in unsanitary conditions.  They think they look to the future, but they only see the present or the past.  They are more scared than they will admit and more confused than they will ever understand.  They routinely grasp at straws.  Their minds are derelict castles in which only ghosts reside.  They search for happiness in transient relationships and meaningless sex, never stopping to realize that they&apos;ve found none.  They hide their pain from others and from themselves.  They are driven by dreams of escape.  Their dreams only drive them deeper in.  All they can do is hold on to their delusions, close their eyes, and plug their ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And furthermore, I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://meaghan.hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2003_12.shtml#000115&quot;&gt;Carthage&lt;/a&gt; should be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Having successfully spent &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too much money on Nintendo products, my inconspicuous consumption will shortly (~2 weeks) be rewarded with the greatest of all possible treasures: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nintendo.com/zeldaclassic/&quot;&gt;Zelda: Collector&apos;s Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
And Sean said, &quot;I gots to get my Zelda on&quot;.  And Sean visited the site, and Sean entered the various codes.  And Sean saw that it was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then Sean said, &quot;come on, come one, come on!&quot;  And Sean knew he must now play the waiting game.  And it was so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And Sean did play the waiting game, and then Sean said, &quot;oh, the waiting game sucks!&quot;  And Sean did play Hungry Hungry Hippoes.  And Sean saw that it was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But then his email did Sean check, and there the confirmation message he did see.  And Sean said, &quot;this is great!&quot;  And it was so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;http://swcyella.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Her Highness&lt;/a&gt; was initially a bit miffed about the Carthage line at the end of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2003_12.shtml#000071&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.  Her reasoning was that I was saying something about her that she didn&apos;t understand, and thus it was likely an insult.  Sharp girl, &lt;i&gt;n&apos;est pas&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real story is as follows: for a variety of reasons, far beyond the scope of this blurb, a number of Romans felt a great deal of hostility towards Carthage in the period around 200 BC.  The hostility actually extended quite a ways on either side of 200 BC, but it&apos;s around 200 BC that&apos;s important here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right around the time period in question, Cato the Elder was a Roman statesman, a senator I think, who held a particular grudge against Carthage.  And so, to ensure the issue wouldn&apos;t be forgotten, he would end every speech by saying, &quot;&lt;i&gt;ceterum censeo Carthago delenda est&lt;/i&gt;&quot;.  Which, loosely translated, means, &quot;and furthermore, I think that Carthage should be destroyed&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Or more literally, &quot;and furthermore, I think Carthage is {fated / destined / required / needed} to be destroyed&quot;.  It&apos;s almost a sort of fulfilling-fate, doing-the-gods&apos;-will sort of tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&apos;s kind-a like the French &lt;i&gt;exiger&lt;/i&gt; in that the concept is very clear, very simple, and very nearly impossible to cleanly translate to English.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Cato would &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; end his speeches with this.  He could be talking about foreign affairs or simply leading a toast - it didn&apos;t matter to him.  So it makes a good funny ending to long rants that may seem too serious.  It&apos;s kind-a like saying &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiftiesweb.com/burma.htm&quot;&gt;&apos;Burma Shave&apos;&lt;/a&gt; after a particularly dreadful piece of poetry.  Not that I imagine a whole lot of people will be getting that reference either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now that you know, go use it in a history paper.  If your teacher gets the reference, s/he will be pretty bloody impressed.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Current site status:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Readable with Safari, Mozilla, IE5 Mac&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unreadable in IE6 Win (content area underlaps sidebar)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark sigil appears on Safari, Mozilla, IE6 Win&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Light sigil appears on Safari, Mozilla, IE5 Mac, IE6 Win&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&apos;ve got things working perfectly in Safari and Mozilla, nearly perfectly in IE5 Mac, and horribly in IE6 Win.  Ironically, the change that fixed IE5 Mac is what broke IE6 Win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m getting really sick of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sad note: Apparently Safari won&apos;t animate background GIFs.  I can understand the decision, but it&apos;s still disappointing.  Switch temporarily to another browser if you want to marvel at the splendour of my flickering Christmas lights.  Or I guess you could just &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/images/title-xmas.gif&quot;&gt;view them directly&lt;/a&gt;.  They look better in context, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the moment, only Mozilla is rendering everything correctly.  Rah-rah open source, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;In my view, if you hire someone to do X, then they should mostly be doing X.  None of this hey-let&apos;s-call-him-an-engineer-and-then-make-him-a-fucking-courier crap.  Not that I&apos;m bitter.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

I know it&apos;s amazing that they&apos;re able to produce a comic on that schedule, but I also have a hard time appreciating the difficulty because, well, I can&apos;t draw.  I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;, however, able to write, and so the fact that they have a new news post three times a week is an achievement I&apos;m able to appreciate in a slightly-fuller-but-still-not-full fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is really a long-winded way of saying that I haven&apos;t posted in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anybody besides &lt;a href=&quot;http://swcyella.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Her Highness&lt;/a&gt; (and the three anonymous users I&apos;ve noted in my logs) ever visited here I might even feel guilty.  Instead I just feel lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something, I might add, to which I am fully accustomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simonandgarfunkel.com/&quot;&gt;Simon and Garfunkel&lt;/a&gt; are probably the most rocking sexagenarians (it sounds dirty, but it&apos;s &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;) around.  The immediate family went to a the recent concert in Sunrise (at the peculiarly-named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officedepotcenter.com/&quot;&gt;Office Depot Center&lt;/a&gt;) and I was quite impressed.  The concert featured a &apos;surprise&apos; appearance by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everly.net/&quot;&gt;the Everly brothers&lt;/a&gt;, who are also remarkably well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, the only disappointment is that they never played &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.cis.net/sammy/kodacrm.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kodachrome&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I guess I really have no right to expect something from Simon&apos;s solo years to show up at a reunion tour. Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seahawk.org/&quot;&gt;CSN&lt;/a&gt; reunion last night.  As was the case during the time I actually &lt;i&gt;attended&lt;/i&gt; the school, I only recognized a fraction of those present.  A fraction with a denominator rather significantly larger than its numerator, I must add.  Noticed something odd today, though; with a single exception, all my friends from HS have four-letter appellations available (I say &lt;i&gt;available&lt;/i&gt; because C_ was originally introduced to me under quadra-charactered nomenclature - it&apos;s a long story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went back to Casa Del P_ later for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coolgames.com/mfg-cat/soc/0494-00.htm&quot;&gt;Catan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://smashbrosmelee.com/&quot;&gt;videogames&lt;/a&gt;.  I won my first game of Catan ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy dance!&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Which gets me even more confused, because &apos;ROTJ&apos; can be either &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starwars.com/episode-vi/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005Y71K/002-9729822-1193654?v=glance&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return of the Joker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the context (mostly the first though).&lt;/p&gt;

Most people to whom he explained this idea thought it was a pretty interesting idea with a lot going for it, and that it beat the hell out of the current system of being assholes all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then he decided to commit suicide by pissing off the governing authority, and in doing so he screwed over his best friend Judas, a hapless bureaucrat named Pilate, and (as history turned out) basically his entire religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But then his friends who he hadn&apos;t messed with decided he was the son of God, so they started a new religion and started building churches on rocks and drawing tiny little fishes on doors, and as time went by there were Popes in Rome and schisms all over and theses nailed to doors and eventually crazy guys claiming native Americans came from Jerusalem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So now it&apos;s 2000 years later, and we celebrate this man by putting shiny crap on plastic trees, pretending that rabbits lay eggs, and putting enormous gold fish logos on the back of our SUVs.  And listening to Creed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, the point of this is that there was a man, some people believe he was a magic man, but most people agree he was at least a pretty nice man, except for that whole thing where he wanted to die and fucked his friends, and a long time ago he got himself nailed to a tree somehow and for some reason that&apos;s important to a whole lot of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And this man&apos;s name?  I forgot.&lt;/div&gt;

<entry id='76' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2003://1.76' author_id='1' authored_on='20031222192300' basename='sean_explains_b' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233136' modified_on='20080324233136' ping_count='0' status='2' title='Sean Explains Buddhism' week_number='200352'><text>&lt;p&gt;As promised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
So this prince named Siddhartha was born, and a fortune teller of some sort prophesied he would be either a powerful king or the saviour of all humanity.  Siddhartha&apos;s father, being the rather shortsighted type, decided to go with option one and showered his son with material wealth such as royalty typically enjoyed in those great days before there were tabloids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Because kids basically always end up doing the opposite of what their fathers want (except for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2003_12.shtml#000078&quot;&gt;that one guy with the long hair&lt;/a&gt;), Siddhartha ended up sick to death of all the toys and desired a spiritual life.  The problem was, he thought that all the popular religions were silly and so he set out to come up with his own.  So he thought for awhile, came up with nothing, and then decided to just rip off the more existential aspects of existing religions and change his name to Buddha, because Siddharthism just doesn&apos;t sound very friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Buddha decided that there were four truths governing the world, which are that (1) life sucks,  (2) that it sucks because we want stuff, (3) that if we stop wanting stuff it&apos;ll stop sucking so hard, and finally that (4) Buddha&apos;s 8-step program will make the sucking stop now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Buddha&apos;s 8-step program, which his marketing department wisely insisted he call the Noble Eightfold Path, basically boils down to being nice to each other (a philosophy later supported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2003_12.shtml#000078&quot;&gt;that guy with the sandals&lt;/a&gt;), but he fleshed that out into eight points because his professor wanted an eight-page paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

After coming up with all this, Buddha started to seriously put on weight, and eventually passed on at a relatively old age.  Afterwards his followers journeyed around the countryside in yellow robes, not really accomplishing anything other than ticking off people they met, until one of them got lucky and converted a king of some sort about two hundred years later.  Because kings were really popular in those days, everyone jumped on the bandwagon and converted, and then later some people jumped on a boat and went elsewhere, bringing yellow robes and statues of the morbidly-obese Buddha with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

There was also some stuff in there about  something called karma, which basically means somebody&apos;s counting how often you act like an asshole, and transcendence, which basically means that if you ever stop wanting things entirely life will stop sucking entirely but you&apos;ll also effectively cease to exist, but you won&apos;t mind &apos;cause your life, such as it is, will totally kick ass.  But frankly I don&apos;t really understand all that, I&apos;m really stuck way back on the part where the ascetic who condemned indulgence became extremely fat.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I think I&apos;m done.  I really have no arguments with Judaism (though like Stewie I&apos;m really not a hat person), and making fun of Muslims is like making fun of fish; it&apos;s easy as hell, but the fact that they don&apos;t seem to care makes it a good deal less satisfying.  Then again, fish don&apos;t kill you for disagreeing with them, so perhaps I should shut the hell up.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

It&apos;s just you and I, Dear Reader.  I don&apos;t like sharing.  It&apos;s not something I&apos;m good at, and it&apos;s not something I enjoy.  All the same, sometimes I need to scream, and this site, such as it is, is the wilderness in which I choose to do so.  I try to stifle my screams; I try to use vague language to mask the truth, I try to avoid names.  It&apos;s not quite as effective as a full-on shout to the heavens, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here it is.  No obtuse language, no absurd metaphors.  Here&apos;s who I am, pure, undiluted Sean.  If your browser melts, then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as long as I&apos;m in this sort of a mood, whoever the hell is googling &quot;sean kerwin naples&quot; from the Naples Bay area should be aware of two facts: first, that perfect anonymity is impossible so long as I have server logs, and second, that I don&apos;t like lurkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
I was born in New Jersey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

After I was born my parents moved in with my Dad&apos;s parents.  I called them Grandma and Pop.  They&apos;re dead now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Mom and Grandma never seemed to like each other much.  I still don&apos;t know why.  I think they thought I never noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Eventually Mom and Dad built a house for us.  It was next door to Grandma and Pop&apos;s house.  I think Grandma and Pop gave Mom and Dad the land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

There weren&apos;t a lot of kids near us. I never met any.  They went to public school.  I went to private.  Mom drove me there every school morning.  I think it was about an hour, but I don&apos;t remember.  I was little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Grandma was a teacher at a public school.  I think it hurt her feelings that I went to private school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

My only friend was Jeff.  He started out going to the private school, but then he left.  We never talked about why.  We stayed friends for a long time.  I haven&apos;t spoken to Jeff for a long time.  Since Grandma died, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In preschool I learned to read.  In kindergarten I realized my name was spelled wrong.  Sometimes other kids pronounced it wrong on purpose to hurt my feelings.  I thought Mom and Dad had played a joke on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Mom&apos;s father lives in New York City.  For a while I called him New York Pop.  I think this was Mom&apos;s idea.  He found out, and now I call him Poppa.  It sounds funny to me when I say Poppa.  He sends me a check every Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I used to wonder if Poppa sent the check himself, or if he had somebody who did it for him.  One year he forgot to send checks, and now I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I never met Mom&apos;s mother.  She was named Cynthia.  She smoked and it killed her.  Poppa and she divorced before Mom and Dad got married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Poppa&apos;s wife is Betsy.  I don&apos;t call her Grandma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Grandma Lois used to be Poppa&apos;s wife until they got divorced.  She lives on Long Island.  I don&apos;t see her often.  I call her Grandma.  Her husband was Richard.  I didn&apos;t know him well, but he was funny.  He&apos;s dead now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We always had cats.  I don&apos;t remember Chairman Meow, but I do remember Spot, L.L. Bean, and Putty-Tat.  Spot would chase after a stick if you threw it, but she wouldn&apos;t bring it back. They&apos;re all dead now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Putty-Tat wasn&apos;t our name.  Mom got him when her stepfather died.  I think his name was Bill Robinson, and I think he married Grandma Cynthia after she and Poppa got divorced.  I don&apos;t remember ever meeting him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Pop smoked cigarettes.  I think he said once he started in the army.  We tried to get him to quit and eventually he did.  We were all happy when he stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

When I was four my sister was born.  Her name is Meaghan.  This time I knew the spelling was a mean joke.  Her middle name is Cynthia.  I think Cynthia is a pretty name.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I remember the morning Meaghan was born.  I woke up on the floor that morning.  I had fallen out of bed while I slept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

My last teacher at the private school in New Jersey was Ms. Pace.  She was really nice and really mean at the same time.  She taught us algebra the first year, and geometry the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Ms. Pace was married, but she made us call her Miss instead of Missus.  I didn&apos;t understand why.  I still don&apos;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Mrs. Pace bought mechanical pencils for the entire class because she didn&apos;t like pencil sharpeners.  I liked mechanical pencils.  I still do.  They&apos;re good pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Eventually we moved to Florida.  The town we moved to was called Naples.  Mom and Dad bought a house in a place called Victoria Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I cried when we left New Jersey.  Grandma cried too.  Pop didn&apos;t cry, but I knew he was sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We drove both cars to Florida, with L.L Bean in one car and Putty-Tat in another.  Putty-Tat died after we moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The new house was smaller than our old house.  It was hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I went to public school in Florida.  I hated it.  I felt lost.  I made a few friends, but not good ones.  I haven&apos;t spoken to them since I left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One day I got into a fight with another kid.  He was a lot bigger than me.  He punched me in the face and I kneed him in the crotch.  We both got punished, even though he had attacked me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Then I went to see a private school for a day to decide if I wanted to change schools.  I liked it a lot.  I changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One day L.L. Bean diead, and we got two new kittens.  They were black and white and we named them Spooky and Snowball.  Snowball is dead now.  We still have Spooky.  He&apos;s sick now.  He coughs and wheezes a lot.  It makes me sad.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The private school was called CSN.  I stayed there for the rest of middle school and all of high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The kid who was supposed to show me around my first day at CSN was sick, so everybody showed me around.  He came back the next day.  He&apos;s my friend now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Math class was right after lunch at CSN.  We would eat lunch outside the math classroom.  We liked math a lot.  Sometimes we would play games, like taping people&apos;s homework to the ceiling or hiding people pencils.  One kid kept hiding my mechanical pencil.  He stopped eventually, and now we&apos;re friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In eighth grade I was on the math team.  It was fun.  We went to the state competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One day in eighth grade I thought I saw an angel.  I remember when it happened very well.  I try not to think about it, though.  I never talk about it.  It makes me sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One day Mom said that one of her clients from work needed help with his computer.  I helped him and he paid me.  He told other people, and I helped some of them too.  It was a fun job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

When I was in high school I asked a girl I like to a dance once.  She said yes.  Then I found out I was going to New York for Poppa&apos;s birthday party, and that I couldn&apos;t go to the dance.  I think the girl thought I was playing a joke on her.  I try not to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

During high school there was a teacher who played U2 songs during class.  He was cool and we all liked him.  He taught programming, and later he started to teach us calculus.  Then he left the school forever.  I still don&apos;t know what happened.  I&apos;m a little afraid to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

During high school Pop got cancer.  It was from the smoking.  They took out his throat, and he had to hold a machine up to his chin to talk.  I couldn&apos;t understand what he said.  Neither could he.  I was sad.  He was sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Eventually Pop died.  It was a heart attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We flew home for his funeral.  I looked out the window of the plane and tried to see shapes in the clouds, but there weren&apos;t any there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Grandma said that she and Pop had been planning to drive south to see us just before he died.  She was sad when she said it.  She wasn&apos;t thinking.  She didn&apos;t mean to hurt me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Grandma gave me Pop&apos;s watch.  I don&apos;t have it anymore.  It got ruined in a car accident.  I wore it every day until then.  Pop&apos;s watch was made of steel and had a stretching steel band.  I had to wind it every day, but sometimes I forgot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We went back to Florida.  I wished I would die.  Sometimes at school I would find a quiet place alone and close my eyes and try not to cry.  One time I got to the history classroom early and did this.  People started showing up.  A friend put her hand on my back and I jerked away.  I wish I hadn&apos;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I was on the math team in high school.  I was good at it at first.  During my last year I was the president of the math team.  I ran against a friend and beat him.  He deserved to win.  I wished I hadn&apos;t run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One day Grandma had a stroke.  We went home to see her.  She was still Grandma, but she was different.  It made me a little sad.  I wondered if it might be better if she had died, and that made me even more sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Then Grandma died.  I remember riding in the limousine to the cemetery where they were going to bury her.  People were making jokes.  I wanted to kill them all for telling jokes when Grandma was dead.  I wanted to die for laughing at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We went home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I had friends at CSN.  I still talk to a lot of them.  I thought we were all happy, but I found out later they were just pretending.  I found out they weren&apos;t really happy later on at a reunion.  It made me sad to hear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One summer I went to a school up north to take a physics class.  Two friends from CSN went too.  It was mostly fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One time I asked a stupid question.  I wish I hadn&apos;t asked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

After high school I went to a school called CMU.  I hated it there.  I didn&apos;t think they were nice to their students.  Later on a kid I knew from CSN committed suicide at CMU.  I think CMU is a bad place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I left CMU.  I came home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I was sad for a while, and then I got a job.  The job wasn&apos;t much fun at first, then it got to be more fun, but then at the end it wasn&apos;t fun at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Sometimes the job would send me to San Francisco or New York City for shows.  I lost my jacket in San Francisco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One day I was in a car accident.  My car was ruined.  So was Pop&apos;s watch.  I think the watch was worth a lot more than the car.  I got a new car.  I don&apos;t wear a watch anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One day I quit the job and went to a new school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I don&apos;t like the new school a lot, but I have a scholarship.  It pays tuition.  I don&apos;t want Mom and Dad to pay for this school, and I haven&apos;t let them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

They think I won&apos;t let them pay because I feel guilty.  They think I feel like I wasted their money at CMU.  I think I did.  But that&apos;s not why I won&apos;t let them pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I won&apos;t let them pay because I can&apos;t.  I need to do this myself.  Sometimes they get angry at me because they don&apos;t understand.  Sometimes I get angry at them because they don&apos;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I have a web page where I write things sometimes.  I haven&apos;t told anybody about it, and nobody reads it.  It&apos;s like screaming in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I feel like screaming a lot, but mostly I don&apos;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Sometimes I wonder if I&apos;m a bad person.  I don&apos;t want to be.
&lt;/div&gt;</text></entry>

Trying to catch back up with the world after a week in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a tough trick, because I was never really caught up with the world before.  Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;rightfloating&quot; src=&quot;images/paintball.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;I went paintballing last Saturday.  A remarkable sport.  Really gets the adrenaline flowing.  I got shot in the face. I&apos;m struck by the close resemblance between paintball helmets and the helmet the &lt;a href=&quot;http://halo.bungie.org/story/masterchief.html&quot;&gt;M.C.&lt;/a&gt; wears in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/&quot;&gt;Halo&lt;/a&gt;.  Coincidence?  I think... probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

My vision for the future is one in which my benign and benevolent dictatorship has ended all world problems and placed large marble statues of myself in most larger parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can no doubt imagine, this whole &apos;war on terror&apos; thing kinda puts a damper on that.  Apparently world domination is some kind of a frickin&apos; &lt;i&gt;taboo&lt;/i&gt; now.  Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway.  I&apos;ve been thinking, and you know what?  World domination would be, to use the technical term, a huge fucking pain in the ass.  So to hell with it.  You bastards don&apos;t deserve my iron-fisted rule, any more than you deserve the utopian paradise that would no doubt result from my watchful eye and fervent desire to erase Barney the dinosaur from the annals of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I mean that literally.  Upon taking final control I would set up a small section of the world, say, Japan, as a research lab devoted to advanced temporal manipulation technology, with the singular goal of erasing that thrice-damned satan-spawned purple extinct menace from the history of time.  That, and maybe trying to bring a young copy of Barbara Eden into the present.  Because, you know, she was hot back in the day.  I&apos;m just sayin&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is the end.  No longer shall I seek to follow in the footsteps of great men like Lex Luthor, Doctor Evil, or The Brain -- Except, obviously, I would only be following in their footsteps up to a point, and then, you know extrapolating onward from there -- instead I shall use my awe-inspiring super powers, like memorizing song lyrics and quoting &lt;i&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/i&gt;, for Good, rather than Evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe I&apos;ll turn my weapons of mass destruction into Mars probes.  It&apos;s time somebody competent took a stab at sending something to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, maybe I could conquer Mars...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Her highness &lt;a href=&quot;http://meaghan.hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/&quot;&gt;has moved in&lt;/a&gt;, and I suspect most of her friends are bright enough to wonder what precisely she&apos;s a subdomain of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, new visitors.  Welcome to the Skirwan&apos;s weblog.  I mostly go by Sean &apos;round here, and I rant and ramble and very rarely make much sense.  The title&apos;s in Latin, the writing&apos;s inscrutable, and the author&apos;s insane.&lt;/p&gt;

It would be kinda nifty to have the interesting events for every post attached, but I&apos;m not sure how to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://movabletype.org/&quot;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt; do that.  I suppose it would be possible to add an include directive to the end of every post in the template and then modify the CGI to take the posting date as an argument, but I&apos;m not really sure my poor server could handle that.  It&apos;s old and sickly.  It coughs a lot, at the very least, though I suppose that could be attributed to hypochondria.  It&apos;s a big problem with webservers, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source of this useless is rambling is the end of the Christmas season, and the realization that I&apos;ve gotten so used to seeing the little &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/images/logo-xmas.gif&quot;&gt;Christmas hat on my sigil&lt;/a&gt; up in the top-left that the little guy seems bland without it.  I guess I&apos;m going to have to come up with little doohickeys (the technical term) for various holidays and pseudoholidays and arrange a CGI script to automagically insert them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh.  Sounds like a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as I&apos;m making a to-do list, I also need to fix the comment preview and error template for &lt;a href=&quot;http://meaghan.hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/&quot;&gt;Her Highness&apos;s blog&lt;/a&gt;, and probably my own as well, not - that - that&apos;s - really - an - issue - cause - unlike - Meaghan - I - don&apos;t - get - any - comments - cause - nobody - loves - me - but - I - don&apos;t - care - cause - I&apos;m - generally - an - antisocial - bastard.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

You might notice a few changes, the most interesting of which would surely be the alternate stylesheet selectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the net upshot is that you can read my blog and &lt;i&gt;pretend&lt;/i&gt; you&apos;re reading Meaghan&apos;s blog.  Which is really the best of both worlds, because she&apos;s a far more interesting person while I&apos;m a far better writer.  I&apos;ve often said that if our parents had had a single child he or she would&apos;ve been far happier and much more well-adjusted - even though the gender confusion would&apos;ve been tough on the poor hypothetical kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later (probably later, as there are still some kinks to work out) this &lt;i&gt;exciting new feature&lt;/i&gt; will propagate over to Her Highness&apos;s blog, where the heavier usage and wider variety of browsers will promptly break everything and probably cause the server to either explode or just quit and retire to Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&apos;t it good to know I have this all planned out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;ll also be some sort of an hideously-ugly, no-frills, black-on-white theme, which will hopefully placate Her Highness&apos;s visitors of a mystical bent.  Damned whiners.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

One is minimalistic and is my response to comments about the tulip theme being too complicated, while the other is frivolous and amuses me greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second would be a lot more accurate if there were some mechanism in CSS to reorder elements - you&apos;ll notice I&apos;ve put the date headers on the title bars for each post, but any long-time slashdotter will know that&apos;s not right.  Hopefully there&apos;ll be something like this in CSS4...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like it should be possible; within and XML structure of a blog it would make sense for any attribute of a post (date, poster, title, body) to appear in any order - and if I remember my XML correctly, there&apos;s really no way for a schema to enforce any particular (preferred?) ordering.  Here&apos;s hoping something like this shows up someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most everything appears to break under IE5/Win, and most of my stylesheets are subtly wrong in IE5/Mac.  And I have no info on IE6/Win anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

He&apos;s an ill-mannered drunken slob, and if he dropped dead of a wasting disease I doubt I&apos;d shed a tear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was back home this weekend, working on something that necessitates being on the far side of the fascist uber-firewall that this so-called school has inflicted on me, and during my abscence the apartment was, to engage in a rather heinous act of understatement, trashed.  Apparently there was quite a bit of &lt;i&gt;partying&lt;/i&gt; going on this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say &apos;&lt;i&gt;partying&lt;/i&gt;&apos; rather than the more simple &apos;partying&apos; because in this context &apos;&lt;i&gt;partying&lt;/i&gt;&apos; means &lt;i&gt;unwanted drunken goings-on&lt;/i&gt; rather than the more traditional definition concerning the particple form of enjoyable festivities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, apparently our resident whomever (R.A.? R.M.?  Something...) had words with HellRoommate.  I had a brief discussion with The Man today, and it was made quite clear in a distinctly subtextual fashion that well-phrased testimony could start us all down the path to removing the unwanted element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds great, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, I&apos;d feel guilty.  There&apos;s no rational reason for guilt; he clearly has it (&apos;it&apos; meaning eviction and several other inconveniently complex forms of karma) coming.  He&apos;s not the sort of... &apos;individual&apos;... for whom I should feel compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be nice to be evil.  Lex Luthor would&apos;ve had this bum out of here months ago.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='87' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2004://1.87' author_id='1' authored_on='20040202123500' basename='they_do_one_thi' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233137' modified_on='20080324233137' ping_count='0' status='2' title='They Do One Thing Well' week_number='200406'><text>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve often said that the only things Microsoft does right are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productlist.aspx?type=Mouse&quot;&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;.  I&apos;ve had an Intellimouse Explorer - the old style, with the big thumb buttons - for quite a while, and I&apos;ve liked it immensely.  But, with the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/&quot;&gt;Expos&#233;&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;ve felt an unavoidable compulsion to upgrade to a mouse with one more button, one shiny, eminently-pressable button which I could assign to Expos&#233; and then, you know, push.  Occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I set off to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bestbuy.com&quot;&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, fully intent on purchasing something out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?page=products/productlist&amp;amp;ad=hmf&amp;amp;crid=19&amp;amp;countryid=19&amp;amp;languageid=1&quot;&gt;Logitech&apos;s MX line&lt;/a&gt; of mice.  They have a buttons above and below the scroll wheel, including one which seemed to be evidence of divine intent insofar as its apparent perfection for use with Expos&#233;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I played with it for a few minutes and bought a new  Microsoft mouse.  Why?  The Logitech mice, for lack of a better term, suck.  It&apos;s completely impossible to hit any of the three buttons lined up with the scroll wheel unless you&apos;re some sort of alien life form or an hideous mutant who &lt;i&gt;lacks bones&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, on the other hand, has refined their existing kick-ass designs by eliminating the clicking from the scroll wheel entirely (it takes some getting used to, but now that I have ordinary mice just seem &lt;i&gt;ordinary&lt;/i&gt;) and allowing it to &lt;i&gt;tilt&lt;/i&gt;.  I kid you not.  You want to scroll right, just tilt the scroll wheel to the right.  Pretty sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I strongly encourage anyone to take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=002&quot;&gt;the new Wireless Intellimouse Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.  Where in this context, &apos;anyone&apos; of course means the three other people on Earth who care this much about their mouse and found this page by Googline around and checking &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also strongly encourage everyone to make fun of Logitech, but since I doubt anybody out there is searching for &quot;make fun of Logitech&quot; I don&apos;t think that recommandation has quite the same breadth to it.  But then, stranger things have happened.  Like, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.burningman.com/&quot;&gt;Burning Man&lt;/a&gt;.  And that&apos;s &lt;i&gt;annual&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I guess what I&apos;m trying to say here is, in a nutshell, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Imagine further that you&apos;ve got a particularly clever dog, and that you train him to trot one box down the row every time you call out &apos;plus one&apos;.  Imagine further still that you train him similarly for &apos;plus two&apos;, &apos;plus three&apos;, et cetera.  So if the dog&apos;s standing on square four, and you call out &apos;plus five&apos;, he&apos;ll move to square nine, effectively adding the numbers.  You&apos;ve taught a dog how to add, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong.  The dog doesn&apos;t know how to add.  The dog doesn&apos;t understand numbers, addition, or any of the abstract concepts contained therein.  The dog may have some innate sense of quantity (two bones is more than one bone) but even that&apos;s up for debate.  You&apos;ve programmed the dog to give the illusion of numeracy, but the dog is still, in the final analysis, a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I bring this up?  A course I&apos;m taking this semester is taught by a... &lt;i&gt;gentleman&lt;/i&gt;... who programs computers the same way this clever hypothetical dog adds numbers.  And of course, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; is grading &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

For those yet unaware, Sigma is alternative firmware for Motorola&apos;s SURFBoard line of cable modems, which, when loaded via a rather ingenious hardware hack, allows users full control over their modem.  Including, of course, uncapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with the subject, your cable modem could be faster; the speed is artificially limited by the cable company by tweaking settings in the cable modem.  Not too long ago, when uncapping was a new thing, people would uncap their residential cable modem service and get truly mind-boggling throughput.  Obviously cable companies were less than thrilled about this, and started cracking down.  At the moment, as I understand it, uncapping is the exclusive province of the very brave and the very foolish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But reading about Sigma got me thinking.  Apparently these modems are typically configured to load their settings from an FTP server, presumably one operated by the cable company.  As most uncappers have already discovered, modifying the settings for your modem will get you cut off, or perhaps even arrested - but what if the settings on the FTP server changed?  It seems counterproductive to terminate &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally lack the skill (and, for that matter, &lt;i&gt;desire&lt;/i&gt;) to do such a thing, but I&apos;m sure that somewhere out there a clever geek with a black hat is working along similar lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just goes to show: security is hard.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Sure you have.  Know what I don&apos;t get?  Listen to the commentators for a bit, and you&apos;ll hear things like, &quot;and he&apos;s lost control of the basketball&quot;, or &quot;and he shoots the basketball,&quot; or &quot;and look at them move that basketball.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the hell don&apos;t they just call it a &lt;i&gt;ball&lt;/i&gt;?  I mean, if you think they&apos;re playing with a &lt;i&gt;football&lt;/i&gt;, you&apos;re probably sufficiently confused that the commentary is the least of your worries.  Likewise if you don&apos;t know what sport you&apos;re watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it!  A 66% reduction in syllables!  They say that word hundreds of times a game - think how much time that is over the course of their lives.  Think how much wear and tear they could save on their poor larynxes (larynxi?  larynxen?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, that&apos;s the end of my weblog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;See what I mean?!&lt;/i&gt;  Somebody call in the ODRDO (Office of the Department of Redundancy Department Office).&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not know, the primary drive behind this website is the fact that I&apos;m not the first result for a Google search for my name.  This offends my megalomaniacal side, for obvious reasons.  I used to be first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the latest redesign of my site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/new_index.shtml&quot;&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt;) I decided to try out this plugin.  If you check the preview you&apos;ll see that it&apos;s finally up and running, but it wasn&apos;t exactly an easy experience, especially for one such as I who loathes and fears Perl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply following the instructions will get you absolutely nothing as your reward.  To get any kind of results, you need to add some code to the beginning (just put it with the other &apos;use&apos; declaration, though I don&apos;t think it matter much):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;use MT::Template::Context;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the plugin&apos;s loading, but it won&apos;t do anything useful.  You can get the version number, but whenever you try to use the blasted thing for its intended purpose, you&apos;ll get a thoroughly uninformative error message, along the lines of &quot;Service description &apos;file:lib/MT/GoogleSearch.wsdl&apos; can&apos;t be loaded: 501 Protocol scheme &apos;file&apos; is not supported.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out (and here&apos;s the part that caused much head-scratching and nearly as much cursing) you need to replace the five lines after the comment about &apos;GoogleSearch.wsdl&apos; with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;my $google_search = SOAP::Lite-&amp;gt;service(&quot;http://api.google.com/GoogleSearch.wsdl&quot;);&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;ll do it.  I know that doesn&apos;t look like much, but trust me, &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt;.  Apparently the installation of Perl or SOAP::Lite (I&apos;m still not sure which) that comes with Panther doesn&apos;t like &apos;file:&apos; URIs.  As a result, it fails with a largely-useless and thoroughly uninformative error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway - great module, crappy Darwin support.  Hopefully anybody else in the same situation will find this page on Google and be saved the headache.  Almost makes me wish I had TrackBack set up so I could ping the author of the plugin, &apos;cause I&apos;m pretty sure both of those changes really &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be in effect everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Obviously the man is just as capable of wit off the air:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the road less traveled by and they CANCELLED MY FRIKKIN&apos; SHOW. I totally shoulda took the road that had all those people on it. Damn.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, despite an ever-broadening demographic and a 37% rise in ratings, &lt;i&gt;Angel&lt;/i&gt; has been shuffled to the ever popular &apos;never&apos; timeslot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this puts me in a quandry - do I want a new Buffiverse spinoff?  On the one hand, I want to know what happens to all these characters, and this world.  On the other hand, if you kept adding series to the franchise sooner or later you&apos;d end up with Xander marooned in the Delta Quadrant fighting off Borg.   And that&apos;d be bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really pisses me off when networks do this.  The network was gushing about how nice they were to announce this so early, but that&apos;s total bull; at this point much of the season has been shot, and I&apos;m sure nearly all of it has been written or at least planned.  There&apos;s no way to wrap up all the loose threads in the remaining time, because some of them would need at least a full season to resolve fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the network cared about the happiness of the viewers - or rather, the satisfaction of their customers - they&apos;d announce now that &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; season would be the last.  That&apos;d give Whedon and company time to cobble together some kind of passable finale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah well.  For those keep score, the only good show left on the WB network is &lt;i&gt;Smallville&lt;/i&gt;.  But we &lt;i&gt;Angel&lt;/i&gt; fans can still tune in to &lt;i&gt;Charmed&lt;/i&gt;!  Yeah, &lt;i&gt;Charmed&lt;/i&gt;!  It&apos;s just like &lt;i&gt;Angel&lt;/i&gt;, in that it never would have happened without &lt;i&gt;Buffy&lt;/i&gt;, but it&apos;s much faster-paced because they decided to forego plot entirely, electing instead to just put Alyssa Milano in a new costume every week.  Yeah, &lt;i&gt;Charmed&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

I&apos;ve grown a lot more comfortable with both CSS and MT template tags since my last rework, so I&apos;ve taken the time to add some nifty things in the new version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One innovation you might notice in the second preview is the coloration of the comments.  Ideally I&apos;d like to be able to assign a name (and possibly icon) to visitors, but that&apos;s not really possible at the moment - when MT 3.0 rolls out with user registration for the comment system, that should hopefully do the trick.  In the mean time, I decided to break up the monotony by making each entry a different color in a rotating three-color set.  In theory it should be possible to do this with sibling selectors in CSS, but that would be an ugly hack: you&apos;d have guess at the maximum number of comments you&apos;d ever have and hard-code that many CSS rules.  Also, it wouldn&apos;t work right in Internet Explorer most of the time.  Ah, IE - it makes the web exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick I went with was the following lovely bit of obfuscation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&quot;color&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;MTComments&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;MTSwitch value=&quot;[MTGetVar name=&apos;color&apos;]&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;MTSwCase value=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;
    
    &amp;lt;li class=&quot;firstcolor&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&quot;color&quot; value=&quot;2&quot;&amp;gt;
      
    &amp;lt;/MTSwCase&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;MTSwCase value=&quot;2&quot;&amp;gt;
    
    &amp;lt;li class=&quot;secondcolor&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&quot;color&quot; value=&quot;3&quot;&amp;gt;
      
    &amp;lt;/MTSwCase&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;MTSwCase value=&quot;3&quot;&amp;gt;
    
    &amp;lt;li class=&quot;thirdcolor&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&quot;color&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;
      
    &amp;lt;/MTSwCase&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/MTSwitch&amp;gt;
  
    &amp;lt;h3 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;$MTCommentAuthor$&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;MTIfNonEmpty tag=&quot;MTCommentURL&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href=&quot;&amp;lt;$MTCommentURL$&amp;gt;&quot;&amp;gt;[&amp;lt;$MTCommentAuthor$&amp;gt;&apos;s site]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/MTIfNonEmpty&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
    
    &amp;lt;h4 class=&quot;attribution&quot;&amp;gt;
      Posted at 
      &amp;lt;$MTCommentDate format=&quot;%l:%M %p&quot;$&amp;gt;
      on 
      &amp;lt;$MTCommentDate format=&quot;%A %B %e, %Y&quot;$&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;
    
    &amp;lt;$MTCommentBody smarty_pants=&quot;1&quot;$&amp;gt;
  
  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/MTComments&amp;gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m sure any programmers out there are rolling their eyes and saying duh right now, but I figured some normal folk out there might find this useful.  Essentially, the MTSetVar variable named &quot;color&quot; is used to store a number between 1 and 3 (inclusive).  For each comment, we use the MTSwitch plugin to print out a &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; element with the appropriate class, and then update the variable to the next color value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; thought it was nifty.  Though the colors aren&apos;t final - I may mute the comments down or change them to varying grays to provide more differentiation from the category colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few other little tricks I&apos;ve come up (or more likely reinvented) while doing this.  I&apos;ll probably provide similar writeups for those, if/when I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;UPDATE: My old code-displaying markup is stupid.  Try viewing &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2004/02/19/alternating_colors_in_mt.shtml&quot;&gt;this page with new design&lt;/a&gt; if you actually want to read the text.&lt;/div&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='94' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2004://1.94' author_id='1' authored_on='20040221014700' basename='adapative_post' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233137' modified_on='20080324233137' ping_count='0' status='2' title='Adapative Post Listings' week_number='200408'><text>&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll note the new site design is live, more-or-less.  Style switching is nonfunctional and will remain that way until I update the alternate styles, while the archives are under development and should be completed soon.  I suppose I shouldn&apos;t have gone live till all the pieces were ready, but I was bored and it&apos;s not like anybody&apos;s going to complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting challenge came up in writing the by-category archive template.  I wanted to list all entries for that category, with the first ten showing up in the nifty little preview boxes from the front page and the remainder just being in a list.  You can see what I&apos;m talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/journal.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the current in-progress journal entry list.  I&apos;ve decided to call this &apos;adaptive listings&apos;, for the simple reason that I can&apos;t think of anything else to call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&apos;d think could just do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;MTEntries lastn=&quot;10&quot;&amp;gt;
    (Code for the large display)
&amp;lt;/MTEntries&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;MTEntries offset=&quot;10&quot;&amp;gt;
    (Code for the small display)
&amp;lt;/MTEntries&amp;gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that won&apos;t work; the lower list will duplicate the first ten entries displayed in the upper list, because for some dumb reason the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt; code only works in the prescence of the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;lastn&lt;/span&gt; code.  Of course you could just put in a very large number for &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;lastn&lt;/span&gt; and assume you&apos;ll never have more posts than that in the category, but that&apos;s the sort of &lt;i&gt;simple&lt;/i&gt; ugly hack for which I simply will not stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the following ugly snippet does what I want in a sufficiently scalable fashion that I feel comfortable using it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;MTSetVar name=&quot;displayed&quot; value=&quot;0&quot;&amp;gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course my actual template is formatted such that the resulting HTML file ends up looking nice, but it&apos;s easier to read this way.  The code for the attribution line isn&apos;t included in the snippet above because it&apos;s not really pertinent to this process.  Also, the attribution line has another &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;MTSwitch&lt;/span&gt; block in it and makes things even harder to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2004/02/19/alternating_colors_in_mt.shtml&quot;&gt;other MT template snippet&lt;/a&gt;, this is the kind of thing that makes most fairly up-to-date programmers roll their eyes, or sometimes run screaming.  MT&apos;s template markup is primitive by sufficiently rich that most things can be done provided you&apos;re willing to suffer.  Think of it this way: as Perl is to C++, MT template tags are to assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I&apos;m &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; there&apos;s a better way to do this.  &lt;i&gt;Absolutely positive&lt;/i&gt;.  But I can&apos;t come up with it, short of writing a plugin.  And those have to be written in Perl, and that&apos;s the sort of thing that makes &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;roll my eyes and/or run screaming.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

So, in deference to my linguistic shortcomings, welcome to the &apos;About This Site&apos; page of Sean Kerwin&apos;s &lt;i&gt;Neutiquam Erro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title, &lt;i&gt;Neutiquam Erro&lt;/i&gt;, is a Latin phrase that is generally translated as &quot;I am not lost&quot;.  I trust anyone stumbling their way through life has made a similar feeble protestation at one time or another, even if the thought never finds voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is hosted on an aging Power Mac G4 Sawtooth with a 500 Mhz G4 processor and 1 Gigabyte of RAM.  Its network access it provide via a wireless connection to a LinkSys wireless router hooked to a Motorola SURFBoard cable modem.  External access to the server is provided via port forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server is currently running Mac OS X 10.3.x (Panther).  Pages are served with the standard Apache installation, and the content is managed with Movable Type 2.65.  Apache Virtual Hosts are used to allow subdomains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the MT templates are customized quite heavily; the desire was to produce thoroughly XHTML-compliant code to which a wide variety of skins could easily be applied.  My inspiration in this pursuit was the venerable CSS Zen Garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When viewed at the XHTML level, much of the site is actually within various unordered lists (&lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; tags).  This was a deliberate decision to make the source presentable on a text-only browser.  The CSS used in the site is valid and appears to be working correctly on Safari, Mozilla, IE 5.x Mac, IE 5.x Windows, and IE 6 Windows.  I tweak the CSS constantly and the bulk of the verification/testing is done with Safari or Mozilla, so I make no guarantees about the other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MT is extended by use of the SmartyPants plugin, which provides attractive typography, the MTSwitch plugin, which allows a number of nifty techniques in the templates, and the the Acronym plugin, which automatically adds &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;acronym&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; tags around familiar acronyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The random text you&apos;ll see on many pages -- such as the &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt; quote above and the random song excerpt below -- is generated by a rather simplistic shell script I&apos;ve written.  The output from the script is integrated into the page content using server-side includes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &apos;today in history&apos; section on the front page is also generated by a short shell script.  This script essentially &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt;s through the FreeBSD calendar files and picks out everything that matches the current date.  This script is also included in the page using SSI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link list is actually generated by another blog within MT; this blog outputs a file which is then imported into the sidebar module using the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MTInclude&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; tag.  The categories in the link blogs become the section headers, the post titles become the link labels, and the post content becomes the actual link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To facilitate laziness, all the redundant parts of the site are stored as MT modules which are the imported as appropriate.  Because the comment preview and error pages are dynamically generated and thus cannot make use of the SSI feature for the random quote and song lyrics, two copies of each module exist; one dynamic with the SSI, one static with hard-coded quote and lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[UPDATED 10/2/04]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more things stay the same, the more... Well, I guess it doesn&apos;t work as well backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site has been pretty thoroughly made over since the above was originally set down.  The Zen aspirations are no more; the site has one theme, the requirements of which dictate the structure of the markup to a fairly significant extent.  The new look was described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2004/09/07/neutiquam_erro_reloaded.shtml&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on September 7th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new in the interval is the nify new &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/songs.shtml&quot;&gt;recent songs page&lt;/a&gt;, which contains a list of songs I&apos;ve played in iTunes since the last time the list was reset.  It uses some pretty nifty perl code (of which I&apos;m rather proud) to search for tracks in the Amazon database, cache the cover image locally, and do all sort of other nifty things.  A post detailing the specifics will be forthcoming shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have a javaScript-aware browser, the title and masthead quote fade in as the the page loads.  Totally gratuitous, clearly derivative or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orkut.com/&quot;&gt;Orkut&lt;/a&gt;, but nifty nonetheless, IM-ever-so-HO.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

If you haven&apos;t yet seen the film, I&apos;d advise you read this later.  If you&apos;re the sort who will take this review as a criticism of your faith, then I&apos;d advise you to read this never.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about religion is an inherently dangerous prospect; despite all the lip service to peace and love, most zealots would feel little regret at stomping on the windpipe of a heathen.  Or, for that matter, beating, scourging, and crucifying a heathen.  And it&apos;s obvious that Mel Gibson&apos;s &lt;i&gt;The Passion of the Christ&lt;/i&gt; has created quite a furor in the days leading up to and following its release.  Unfortunately all the lightning has been drawn to the well-worn rod labeled &apos;anti-Semitism&apos;, while nobody has ignored the controversy long enough to realize the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; horrifying truth: that it&apos;s just not a very good movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Passion&lt;/i&gt; is a movie with a meaning; Gibson wants you to &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt;, and it&apos;s clearly the sort of story that elicits emotional and spiritual involvement - witness that whole Christianity thing.  Unfortunately the film seems reluctant to let the story stand on its own merits.  Instead of unobtrusively telling the what is arguably most famous story of all time, Gibson feels the need to insert himself.  Not in a literal sense, mind you - but in a real enough fashion that you&apos;ll never confuse Gibson&apos;s epic with the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest complaint is the addition of a new character, a shadowy, hooded figure with no eyebrows who is apparently intended to represent the Devil, the Serpent of Eden, or perhaps just Evil in general.  This addition is, to put it lightly, a huge mistake.  I once read a review of the film adaptation of Stephen King&apos;s &lt;i&gt;The Langoliers&lt;/i&gt; which sums up my feeling here quite concisely: it is folly to attempt to give true evil a face.  I privately think of this as the &lt;i&gt;Alien&lt;/i&gt; principle: the less you see of something -- the more indistinct, the more shadowy it remains -- the more frightening it is.  In the first &lt;i&gt;Alien&lt;/i&gt; film you barely saw the titular monster at all, and it was scary beyond words -- your imagination took over and filled in the gaps with your own personal worst nightmare.  Mister no-eyebrows in Gibson&apos;s film violates this principle to ill effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the two-legged serpent himself isn&apos;t the end of the problem -- some elements of the film are nearly cartoonish in their error.  The scene of this poorly-conceived beast screaming in what I can only assume to be Hell is the sort of thing I&apos;d expect from a kindergartner.  The monstrous baby he holds in one scene is sophomoric.  The demonic children who herd Judas towards suicide are cliche.  The single raindrop at the end, the symbolic tear of a crying God, is equally trite.  These mistakes can all be collected under a single summary: Gibson wanted to improve on the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, Gibson&apos;s position going into &lt;i&gt;The Passion&lt;/i&gt; is similar to that of Peter Jackson facing &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;.  Both are treasured works whose devotees know them inside and out, and both are thus touchy subjects.  On the one hand, a straight transcription to film would be empty; if the new medium is allowed to contribute nothing, then the exercise is inherently hollow.  On the other hand, embellishing the story risks alienating the faithful and drawing their ire.  The key difference between Jackson and Gibson, of course, is that Jackson got it right.  &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; omitted some and added little -- &lt;i&gt;Passion&lt;/i&gt; added way, &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other major criticism of &lt;i&gt;the Passion&lt;/i&gt; perhaps more of a pet peeve than anything else; it&apos;s a sin of which nearly every movie is guilty at one time or another.  If I might make a suggestion to the world: Soaring music is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a filmmaking tool, it is a filmmaking &lt;i&gt;crutch&lt;/i&gt;.  If you need melody to make your point then either your point isn&apos;t worth making or you&apos;re just not very good at making it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the charges of anti-Semitism?  I&apos;m not going to go there.  Of course the work isn&apos;t exactly stellar PR for the Jewish faith -- but the portions of the Bible on which the work is based are the real culprit for that, not Gibson.  And since I&apos;m already berating Gibson for his unwillingness to let the Bible alone, it would be a bit hypocritical of me to suggest he erase the strong bias inherent in the source material.  If anything, Gibson should be praised for trying to lessen the blow; the film hinted strongly the Caiphus was leading a minority of the high council in actions that the majority would not allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis, the film is more in line with &lt;i&gt;The Prophecy&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;The Ten Commandments&lt;/i&gt;.  It&apos;s disappointing, really; the film could have been so much more.  But as it stands I would recommend &lt;i&gt;Jesus Christ Superstar&lt;/i&gt; over &lt;i&gt;The Passion of the Christ&lt;/i&gt; any day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

A funny story, if you&apos;re a geek.  Sad one otherwise.  Either way, a story that should be on the Internet somewhere just in case some poor sap out there is hit by the same bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it turns out that AOL for Windows doesn&apos;t actually do its own dialing; it depends on a component called the &quot;Remote Access Service&quot;.  RAS is also accessible from the command line using the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;rasphone&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;rasdial&lt;/span&gt; commands, and apparently is the back end to Windows&apos;s built-in dial-up system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that at some point in the recent past, a security hole was found in &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;rasdial&lt;/span&gt;.  Microsoft patched it, and all is right with the world.  Yay?  Nay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOL 6 is only somewhat compatible with Windows XP.  Apparently some versions of AOL 6 work and some don&apos;t, and there&apos;s no easy way to tell which you have.  But there exists at least one edition of AOL 6 that works with XP and the &lt;i&gt;old&lt;/i&gt; version of &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;rasdial&lt;/span&gt; but not the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m telling this story because I spent the bulk of last Tuesday morning trying to help a friend out with her computer; AOL had suddenly stopped dialing, instead displaying an error message bemoaning it&apos;s inability to open the &apos;phone book file&apos;.  It appears that XP had downloaded and installed the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;rasdial&lt;/span&gt; update in the background, leaving AOL 6 inoperable.  So I installed the AOL update and everything worked fine, right?  Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new version of AOL managed to dial, but was unable to set up the proxy network connection needed to provide TCP access to the rest of the system.  The upshot was that AOL content was accessible unless it went through the web browser.  The solution to this is to delete the phonebook file, stored as &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;C:\Documents&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Settings\All&amp;nbsp;Users\Application \&amp;nbsp;Data\Microsoft\Network\Connections\Pbk\rasphone.pbk&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do you want to go today?&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Or so I&apos;m told.  I haven&apos;t actually managed to download the hack in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have attempted to do so out of curiosity more than anything; I have no problem with the DRM in iTunes.  Would I prefer unprotected files?  I suppose so.  But I seriously doubt the iTMS would exist if the downloads weren&apos;t locked up in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s disturbing to read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/05/2037238&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=141&amp;tid=176&amp;tid=188&quot;&gt;discussion on Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; about this.  Why do people feel the need to turn everything into an ideological war?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really bugs me when people say &quot;Information Wants To Free!&quot; like it&apos;s some sort of rallying cry.  Earth to morons: &lt;i&gt;it&apos;s not&lt;/i&gt;.  It&apos;s a statement of fact, speaking about how things &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; and saying little or nothing about how things &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be.  Information doesn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; anything; information is just data.  This clever bit of anthropomorphism is simply summarizing a phenomenon that should be familiar to anyone who&apos;s shared a secret -- once you tell someone, you can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;-tell them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information wants to be free only in the sense that the spread of information is an inherently progressive phenomenon.  The fact that you can&apos;t put the genie back in the bottle says nothing about the morality of having, releasing, or sharing a genie, or for that matter a bottle.  One could argue that in a truly perfect world you &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be able to stuff a djinn back on in.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

It&apos;s not a big deal for me; MT 2.65 works fine for my needs.  But it&apos;s somewhat dismaying to note my minimal arrangment here (two authors, four blogs, two sites) would be seventy bucks under the new plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, &lt;i&gt;rah-rah capitalism&lt;/i&gt;.  On the other, this abrupt transition from free-for-personal-use to free-for-limited-personal-use is a bit of a bait-and-switch.

I used to play very regularly in high school, and just about two months ago I got dragged back in - ironically by one of the people who got me hooked on &apos;cardboard crack&apos; in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with the game, let me try to explain it in a way that doesn&apos;t make me sound like an idiot: Imagine a game like chess, where each piece serves a different function.  Now further imagine that instead of only six different types of pieces there are hundreds, and that part of the game is choosing and assembling the set of pieces you&apos;ll be using.  Now further imagine that the functions of the pieces are incredibly varied, and interact using a set of rules that really require a computer science background to fully appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic is just like that, except you play it with cards.  Simple, huh?&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Day After Tomorrow&lt;/i&gt; is a mindless action movie that thinks it has a profound social message.  The special effects are great, but the constant bitching about the current Presidential administration&apos;s environmental policies is a bit much for my taste.  If the filmmakers had made even the slightest effort to control their venom, I might even have swallowed the agenda -- I use low-power everything, and I drive the most fuel-efficient car I can afford -- but writing the Vice President as a cartoonish caricature of Cheney was just insulting.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&apos;m sure it&apos;s probably a mistake.

Mainly because I haven&apos;t anything of substance to say.  Got bored and played with CSS for a while the other day; there&apos;s now finally a second theme for the site.  It&apos;s missing a few minor niceties (the elements I use for styling quotes and code blocks are missing, for one) but on the whole it look quite nice in Safari and Mozilla derivatives.  IE 5 Mac basically just puts up a window and vomits on it however.  And I&apos;ve yet to summon sufficient intestinal fortitude to see what the Windows IE versions do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, what the hell kind of a name for a storm is &apos;Charley&apos;?  I didn&apos;t realize we were using nicknames for hurricanes now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s interesting to note that I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;m under an evacuation order or not - some information seems to imply that my entire county has been ordered out, while other info says it&apos;s just the coastal areas, and still more information earnestly informs me that the beach is under &apos;mandatory voluntary evacuation&apos;.  Whatever the holy hell &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah well.  I&apos;m updating this now, even though nobody will ever see it if something goes wrong;  The server is located about nine feet to my right, you see.  Also, FPL has a hard time keeping the lights on even on sunny days, so I&apos;m not holding out much hope that my webserver will be up an running during a category two hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, stranger things have happened.  Like Democrats nominating an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swiftvets.com/&quot;&gt;apparent liar&lt;/a&gt; for president.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strangecosmos.com/content/item/10017.html&quot;&gt;Again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

10: Tell them the tickets weren&apos;t made from recycled paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

9: Require them to count to 911 before letting them through the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

8: Convince them that blubber from slaughtered whales is a major component of celluloid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

7: Tell them Hillary Clinton hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

6: Inform them, feigning appropriate horror, that Michael Moore eats meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

5: Hand them a joint and suggest they see &apos;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&apos; instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

4: Dress in a chicken costume and picket the theater, claiming the movie is offensive to your people.  If they ask to which people you are referring, act offended and threaten to call the ACLU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

3: Tell them Rush Limbaugh loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

2: Tell them they don&apos;t have time to see the movie, as they&apos;ve won a free all-expenses-paid trip to Cambodia.  Send them to Vietnam.  When they return, indignantly inform them that they were indeed in Cambodia, and that the memory is seared - seared - into your memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

And the number one way to prevent liberals from seeing &apos;Fahrenheit 911&apos;:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

1: Tell them all the pre-show advertising is for the Fox News Channel.

This includes most/all of the faculty offices, and many  professors have taken to displaying messages by taping things to the inside of their windows.  Though this phenomenon tends to devote overmuch effort to expounding the God-awful &lt;i&gt;delicacy&lt;/i&gt; of the southwest Florida ecosystem is - at least to my taste - I really can&apos;t argue against free speech.  Which is actually somewhat ironic, but oh-bloody-well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the offices, which I pass on the way to class nearly every day, is owned by a teacher with obvious strong affection for the Democratic party.  No surprise there; this is, after all, a college campus.  Those of us who don&apos;t hug trees recreationally are the only minority without any sort of special treatment.  But what really gets my goat is the that this teacher, whose identity I have thus far resisted the urge to discover, has posted in his or her window the simple statement that, &quot;When Clinton lied, nobody died.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, Vince Foster.  That&apos;s all I&apos;m going to say about that.  Where there&apos;s smoke, there&apos;s usually fire, and we&apos;ve got a great big plume of the grey stuff floating over Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Clinton ordered a US strike on Iraq in 1998, to &quot;attack Iraq&apos;s nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors&quot;.  This attack managed to kill plenty of Iraqi soldiers and civilians, but didn&apos;t seem to phase Saddam Hussein in the least.  Incidentally, this action just so happened to coincide nicely with the start of impeachment hearings against then-President Clinton.  Happy accident, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Clinton ordered a US-led bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999.  The bombing continued for 78 days.  I somehow doubt that we managed to pull that off without hitting anybody.  The Serbian Orthodox Church would seem to agree with me; they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.balkanpeace.org/lan/lan09.shtml&quot;&gt;sued Clinton to stop him from bombing them again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway.  When Clinton lied, nobody died?  I propose a simple rebuttal: When Bush dropped bombs, we &lt;i&gt;stopped&lt;/i&gt; Saddam.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='110' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2004://1.110' author_id='1' authored_on='20040901163800' basename='news_weak' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233138' modified_on='20080324233138' ping_count='0' status='2' title='News?  Weak.' week_number='200436'><text>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been reading Newsweek magazine for as long as I can remember.  It&apos;s always been, to my mind, a fairly accurate read.  It has a bit of a leftish slant, but the editors always seemed to be aware of this bias and actively working to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least that&apos;s how it used to be.  Something seems to have changed - apparently they&apos;ve given up on compensating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent issues Newsweek has become little more than an unapologetic appendage of the Kerry campaign.  Every mention of Bush has been negative, every mention of Kerry has been positive or negative-spun-as-positive, and major electoral issues like the Swift Boat Vets have been relegated to the cartoons page, where the vets are portrayed as lackeys, liars, and babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s check out the cover of the latest issue.  &lt;img style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px; margin-right:0;&quot; src=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/images/newsweek.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &apos;The Virtues and Vices&apos;... well, that&apos;s fair.  You&apos;ve got to take the good with the bad, right?  But what&apos;s this?  &apos;Stubborn Resolve&apos;?  Warning, danger Will Robinson!  Stubborn is an inherently pejorative term.  They don&apos;t call Bush insistent, they don&apos;t call him steadfast, they don&apos;t say he sticks to his guns, they choose to employ an adjective that gets most of its work referring to mules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the big type, the major headline, the main event?  &apos;No Excuses&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&apos;t get it.  What needs to be excused?  An excuse is an explanation for a misdeed or a faux pas... The headline carries within it not only the accusation of some sort of evil, but the conviction of the unspecified act as well.  This sort of headline might have been appropriate if printed in reference to Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton, but to paste this slander in 160-point Helvetica above a president who has only been accused of misdeeds by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michaelmoore.com/&quot;&gt;disingenuous filmmaker&lt;/a&gt; is beyond irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don&apos;t even get me started on the scribblings above the masthead!  &apos;Why are we still in Vietnam&apos;?  We&apos;re in Vietnam because &lt;i&gt;John Kerry took us there&lt;/i&gt;!  His Vietnam service has been the centerpeice of his campaign, and it seems to be the only point on which he wishes to differentiate himself from the incumbent.  Making this campaign about Vietnam was solidly Kerry&apos;s choice.  Just as it was Kerry&apos;s choice to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c-span.org/2004vote/jkerrytestimony.asp&quot;&gt;testify before congress about supposedly witnessing atrocities in Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, just as it was Kerry&apos;s choice to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27211-2004Aug23.html&quot;&gt;lie about being in Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, just as it was Kerry&apos;s choice to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suntimes.com/output/elect/cst-nws-lips27.html&quot;&gt;claim to possess medals that don&apos;t even exist&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, long story short, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be reading Newsweek anymore.  I get more accurate and more up-to-date information from the Internet anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;We had George - pronounced something like &apos;Giorj&apos; - a few years back.  We just had &apos;Charley&apos; - not &apos;Charlie&apos;, not &apos;Charly&apos;, not the basic &apos;Charles&apos; or the more common &apos;Chuck&apos;.  And now &apos;Frances&apos;.  To be followed shortly by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml&quot;&gt;&apos;Gaston&apos; and &apos;Hermine&apos;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must once again repeat my lament: why don&apos;t any of our storms have normal names?  Where&apos;s hurricane Frank?  Joe?  Harry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah well.  At least this one&apos;s aimed at the other coast.  Unless &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fpl.com/&quot;&gt;FPL&lt;/a&gt; decides to throw another one of their just-because blackouts, the server shouldn&apos;t even go down this time.  I&apos;d hope.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

But I&apos;m not stupid, and I&apos;m not too timid, and that means that I occasionally break taboos and commit the unholy sin of noticing patterns and speaking of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Qaeda wants me dead.  If you&apos;re reading this, they probably want you dead too.  Incidentally, everyone in Al-Qaeda is a Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are terrorists holding schoolchildren hostage in Russia.  There are a number of reasons to believe these terrorists are Chechnyan, and that means that they are most likely Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a war being fought in Darfur.  Rampaging militias are attacking everyone they encounter, be they military or civilian.  It just so happens that these militias are composed primarily of Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 26-year-old National Guard Specialist was arrested in February for attempting to provide US military secrets to Al-Qaeda.  Coincidentally, in 1999 Anderson quit being a Lutheran Christian and became a Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran recently announced that it would once against throw caution to the winds - and international law out the window - by restarting its nuclear program.  Iran is a &apos;Theocratic Republic&apos;, a polite euphemism for a religious dictatorship, and by some strange quirk of fate, most of the folks doing the dictating are Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this: Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.google.com/?ned=us&amp;amp;topic=w&quot;&gt;World section of Google News&lt;/a&gt;.  Count the stories that aren&apos;t about Muslims attacking, holding hostage, or blowing something up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I count three.  One about France Telecom raising money, one about China building nuclear power plants, and one about an active volcano in Japan.  So out of twenty stories on the page, seventeen are about Muslims causing trouble.  That&apos;s a lot.  That&apos;s 85% of the world&apos;s problems.  If we eliminate the volcano (acts of God aren&apos;t really anybody&apos;s fault) it&apos;s 17/19 = 89.47%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are good Muslims; I&apos;ve even met some.  But you&apos;ve got to ask yourself what makes members of this group so prone to making headlines - and making rubble, widows, and orphans.  Some would suggest it&apos;s a cultural issue, that Middle Eastern culture is just that screwed up - in fact I read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americanoutlook.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;amp;id3440&amp;amp;pubtype=DailyArticles%3E%20&amp;amp;id=3440&amp;amp;pubtype=DailyArticles&quot;&gt;fascinating article&lt;/a&gt; on that subject recently which I would highly recommend.  But with all due respect to Mr. de Winter, that can&apos;t be all of it, because you&apos;ll remember one of the folks on my little list above was an American convert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Islamic dogma is attractive to individuals who are already disposed towards violent acts?  That would explain Mr. Anderson.  It would also explain why some Muslims practice peace and some fly planes into buildings; the religion in this case would be a red herring, as in any non-selective group (and since you tend to inherit your religion with your last name, I&apos;d say this qualifies as non-selective) you&apos;ll inevitably have some people one each side of sane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that still doesn&apos;t quite explain why so much trouble seems to emanate from the Middle East, from Northern Africa, from the Balkans, and from Indonesia.  It could simply be a statistical coincidence that these regions coincide with that religion, but that degree of correlation is difficult to dismiss out of hand.  If there&apos;s no causal linkage, you&apos;d think there&apos;d be at least one Christian or Hindu or Buddhist world flash-point.  Of course, one might mention India and Pakistan here, or Israel and the Palestinian movement, but most independent observers would agree that these situations are largely Muslim aggression against a state with relative freedom of religion.  This makes it difficult to to call these Hindu or Judaic problems, as there are Muslims in both India and Israel who are free to practice their religion without any threat from the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again: I don&apos;t &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to be racist.  But what other conclusions can you draw?  The bulk of the world&apos;s problem seem to be caused by Muslims, and there doesn&apos;t seem to be any evidence that this is incidental.  I&apos;d really appreciate it if someone out there could provide a nice, logical reason why I&apos;m wrong, because I&apos;d really like to find one.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s remarkable how many don&apos;t seem to have understood what the whole Compassionate Conservative thing is about.  It&apos;s really not about being a conservative, it&apos;s about a more effective and logical way of responding to society&apos;s problems.  The traditional shorthand is that Democrats want to expand social welfare programs and Republicans want to eliminate them.  The CC agenda is essentially the GOP moderating its stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hungry people in this country, there are people who are suffering.  Neither George Bush nor John Kerry wants to see Americans suffering.  Nobody wants to see Americans suffering, except for Al-Quaeda and maybe the French, and I don&apos;t think anybody besides Michael Moore is going to vote for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the traditional Democratic way of helping people is to just give them what they need.  Or more often, what the Democrats think they need.  This may help the problem in the short run; hungry people get food.  But it doesn&apos;t do anything about tomorrow, when those same people will be hungry again.  It creates dependance, and it breeds weakness.  It fosters what Bush brilliantly termed &quot;the soft bigotry of low expectations&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush&apos;s speech last night was excellent, in my always-ever-so-humble opinion.  There were however a few off-notes.  Specifically, it&apos;s tough to reconcile Bush&apos;s belief that &quot;[t]he story of America is the story of expanding liberty&quot; with his support for a Constitutional amendment banning homosexual marriage.  I personally don&apos;t feel particularly strongly one way or the other on this issue, but I&apos;m sure the people who do will jump all over this contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also felt like he was missing something in his platform; he kept telling us we had to hope, that there is greatness in our future, that there are historic goals within our reach, but there were no grand goals presented, outside of continuing what we&apos;re already doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have liked to have seen something sweeping up on that podium: leaving for Mars before his term ends; eliminating gasoline-based cars entirely in the next four years; building a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spaceelevator.com/&quot;&gt;space elevator&lt;/a&gt; by next Tuesday.  Something that would capture our collective imagination, something awe-inspiring, something that seems fantastic and impossible and futuristic and wonderful.  And a lot of the speech seemed to want this certain something as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all though, it was a knockout of a speech.  I didn&apos;t catch Kerry&apos;s rebuttal at midnight (didn&apos;t even hear anything about it till after it was over) but it sounds like the consensus summary is that it was petty and confused, so all in all I&apos;d say Bush won yesterday.  Now he just needs to keep doing that for two months.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

I&apos;ve always preferred the DC comics to the Marvel books.  I&apos;m a particular fan of Superman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People make fun of Superman, because on a logical front the whole concept is laughable.  An alien who happens to look exactly like a human, who somehow uses solar power to fly without wings.  He can shoot heat beams out of his eyes.  His style sense leaves much to be desired.  And somehow, when he dons a pair of glasses, he looks like an entirely different person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know what I like about Superman?  He&apos;s the man of tomorrow.  Superman is about hope, about the possibility of what mankind could become.  He doesn&apos;t kill, he doesn&apos;t even injure when he can avoid it.  He&apos;d willingly die to save innocent lives, and has done so.  The entire DC universe is like that; there&apos;s a core faith in humanity, a deep-down belief that good will triumph over evil simply because that&apos;s the order of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast this to the Marvel comics universe.  Things are dark.  Really dark.  Heroes are hated and feared.  Racism is rampant.  The Marvel universe is about fear.  I recently read a crossover where the Marvel and DC universes intersected (creatively titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=ZYw1hMulF7&amp;amp;isbn=1401202071&amp;amp;itm=1&quot;&gt;JLA / Avengers&lt;/a&gt;), and it&apos;s interesting to see how each team responds to the other world; the Marvel Avengers are overwhelmed by the DC world, refusing to believe such a paradise could arise from anything but fascism, while the DC Justice League members quickly come to the conclusion that the heroes of the Marvel universe simply aren&apos;t trying hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with anything?  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/sareth/&quot;&gt;ever-informative Sareth&lt;/a&gt;, in a comment to my previous post, pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://redryder.blogspot.com/2004_08_29_redryder_archive.html#109401263429739037&quot;&gt;an interesting post&lt;/a&gt; on a site whose archives I really ought to peruse.  Go read it now, or the next paragraph won&apos;t make much sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with Red.  Completely.  And I&apos;ll geekily extend his argument by saying that the first America, Schwarzennegger&apos;s America, his America, &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; America, &lt;i&gt;our America&lt;/i&gt; is all about Superman.  About the belief in truth, justice, and the American way.  About believing that a man can fly.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Rather...' week_number='200439'><text>&lt;p&gt;When I read a (well written) scholarly paper, it comes with footnotes.  I can trace the information back to its original source; I can follow the writer&apos;s logic step by step.  I am presented with all the information necessary to make up my own mind, and if I disagree with the author at least I can nail down the cause and nature of the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read a (well written) legal document, it comes with explicit explanations of all pertinent terms.  I can trace the assumptions of the document; I can follow the logic which is applied to those axioms.  I am given all I need to make up my own mind, and if I disagree with someone while interpreting the document, it is a trivial matter to determine the specific itemized point on which we conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read a (well written) web page, it comes with hyperlinks.  I can trace the information the author is providing; I can read more detailed descriptions or discussions of subsidiary points the author uses to make his or her arguments.  I am provided with all the information I need to determine to what extent I trust or distrust the author, and to what extent I agree or disagree with the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I watch CBS news, I have no choice but to take their word for it.  There are no footnotes.  There are no detailed explanations of information CBS believes to be axiomatic.  There are no hyperlinks.  CBS gives me Dan Rather, brief glimpses of documents, and un-contextualized partial segments of interviews with individuals about whom I possess a similar dearth of information.  I am not provided with sufficient data to interpret events myself.  I am not permitted to hear of interpretations besides those of CBS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why I don&apos;t trust CBS.  Or for that matter ABC.  Or CNN, or MSNBC, or Fox News.  I have a smattering of trust for NBC, but that&apos;s really not founded on any rational basis and the more intelligent part of my mind believes quite strongly that I shouldn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s all I have to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

The Readers&apos; Digest version is that things are actually improving fairly drastically over there, but the media wants you to the think the war&apos;s still going on full throttle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously both sides are skewing the available data to suit their agenda; that&apos;s par for the course with statistics, as I&apos;m sure Mr. Twain informed you (though before anyone jumps in, yes, I know he was just quoting Disraeli, so sit down).  Sareth beat me to this one, so it&apos;s probably just as easy to link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/sareth/10064.html?view=41040&quot;&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/sareth/10064.html?thread=41040#t41040&quot;&gt;my contribution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s pretty much all I have to say about that, at least until Xepel posts his rebuttal to my corollary to Sareth&apos;s rebuttal to Xepel&apos;s rebuttal to Sareth&apos;s rebuttal to Xepel&apos;s comment on Sareth&apos;s post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so this post has no real content at all.  I like it.  I think I&apos;m going to call this meta-blogging, assuming the term isn&apos;t already taken.  It probably is - it&apos;s a cool term.  &quot;Meta-Blogging&quot;: it just rolls of the tongue, doesn&apos;t it?&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff.  Bush made at least one major screw-up, when he responded to a question about Iraq with the line, &quot;But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us&quot;.  It&apos;s pretty clearly a linguistic slip-up more than a sign of true confusion, but Kerry jumped on it nonetheless.  Other than that the only clear mistakes were Kerry&apos;s repeated refusal to address the actual question in favor of going on about Korea for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few subtle points that I think bear dissection, however.  The rest of this post will be even more rambling than usual because it&apos;s two AM and I want to get these thoughts down before I fall asleep.  Please tell me you notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerry told us, &quot;Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it.  Now, if you break it, you made a mistake&quot;.  That&apos;s clearly untrue.  If your intention is to break something, then success is not a mistake.  Obviously a military invasion of a country with the express stated goal of ousting the ruling party is going to result in damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerry&apos;s comments on, &quot;the KGB underneath Treblinka Square,&quot; was also a subtle but significant error.  Treblinka was a Nazi death camp in Poland during WWII.  The word doesn&apos;t even sound particularly Russian; you&apos;d think someone with Kerry&apos;s international flair would&apos;ve noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Bush came off quite well on Korea.  Kerry kept hammering on bilateral talks, and Bush kept calmly explaining how the current five-party plan would be destroyed.  Kerry appeared to not even understand this until the end, when he basically just said Bush was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerry also said the US should&apos;ve offered nuclear fuel to Iran.  I&apos;m not even going to bother addressing this point, because it&apos;s so patently stupid I don&apos;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minutiae aside, I think Bush is the clear winner.  Kerry&apos;s position seems to be that we should&apos;ve waited for the UN before going into Iraq, but that we need to unilaterally jump on Korea and Iran right now, while  Bush kept explaining that the multilateral diplomatic approach was currently working in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure I fully believe either of them, but I find Bush&apos;s policy much more consistent than Kerry&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush tried diplomacy and sanctions against Iraq; when these failed, he resorted to force.  Bush tried diplomacy and sanctions against Libya; it worked, and Libya has disarmed its nuclear program.  Bush is currently trying diplomacy and sanctions against Korea and Iran, and he has not ruled out the use of force if these methods fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerry, on the other hand, is all over the place.  He wanted Iraq handled through diplomacy and sanctions, but he voted to authorize the war.  Now he&apos;s saying the war is a good idea but implemented poorly.  But he wants us to handle Iran and Korea immediately, regardless of international support.  I think.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;If I call a hundred Californian Democrats at random, I&apos;m sure &lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt; half of them will support Kerry.  He&apos;s experiencing a big &apos;ol bounce after the debate.

You&apos;ll need iTunes installed, but if you don&apos;t have iTunes installed yet I&apos;m severely disappointed in you, hypothetial unequipped reader.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/download&quot;&gt;Go download it now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m a big fan of Sarah McLachlan.  Have been since I first figured out that it was she who sang the haunting &lt;a href=&quot;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?selectedItemId=20778&amp;amp;playListId=20811&amp;amp;originStoreFront=143441&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Full of Grace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which played at the end of the season 2 finale of &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;.  Sarah McLachlan rocks, and if anyone says otherwise I will hunt them down and hurl insults at them from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the same, I was nervous watching this video; Apple was pitching it pretty hard, and Lord knows Steve Jobs has shown a clear willingness to spin his company to support his personal politics.  And though I have no idea how McLachlan leans politically the statistics would allow me to make a fairly solid guess given her involvement in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I was waiting for the video to fade to black, and then fade to the Kerry/Edwards campaign logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as occasionally happens, my cynicism was dissapointed, and my faith in humanity recovered just a tiny bit.  The video is a message about how the world needs to be improved, about how much our country wastes on trivial, stupid things, with particular respect to the excesses of the music industry.  And the video is &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; that, with no partisan politics thrown in to cheapen the message.  I&apos;m pretty damned sure that if Sheryl Crow did a video like this it would descend into Bush-bashing before the first chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, three cheers for Sarah McLachalan.  I still have no idea who she&apos;s voting for in November, but I can respect her either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus: pretty music, pretty lady, Irish name... what&apos;s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Kennedy had been shot.  The generation before can still tell you about Pearl Harbor.  My generation has September 11th.  It&apos;s enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at work that morning, and one piece of modern technology SmartDisk lacked at that point was a television antenna.  We tried to keep up with things over the Internet, but it wasn&apos;t easy.  And all I could think about, that whole morning, is where exactly in New York City my Grandfather lives - I don&apos;t know Manhattan that well.  For all I knew, Poppa could&apos;ve been in the building next door.  I was scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m still scared today.  Not so much for my own safety - Naples isn&apos;t exactly a major target - but for those I care about who&apos;ve made major cities their home.  And for this country, if another major attack occurs.  Other countries have rolled over in the face of a massive attack; would we do the same?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too long after September 11th, I had the chance to talk to my Grandfather about things, and I made the comment that I was glad we had George W. Bush in power to deal with these lunatics, that Gore would be more concerned with making friends with bin Laden than with shooting him in the head.  Grandfather agreed with me at the time, as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s voting for Kerry in this election, and so are a great many others.  I can understand why, because Kerry makes a seductive argument: why are we in Iraq, Kerry asks us, if Al Qaeda was the culprit?  Why waste manpower taking out Saddam, if he didn&apos;t sign the order that killed 2,867 Americans?  The answer is that Saddam is dangerous, even if he&apos;s never heard of Al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Kerry frames the war on terror as an act of retribution, of punishment.  He views it as a police action, catching a murderer and bringing him to justice.  This is a shortsighted, foolhardy, and dangerous position.  The war on terror is not a war on Osama bin Laden, it is a war on terrorists of all stripes, all allegiances.  It is an ongoing preemptive action to protect the United States of America from terrorist attacks from any party on any vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone put this to Kerry directly, he&apos;d probably deny it.  But actions speak louder than words, no matter how often, how well, or how eloquently those words are spoken.  John Kerry wants to lead this country in a war of revenge focussed on a single sickly man.  George W. Bush is leading this country in an ongoing mission to weaken, impair, and eliminate threats to this country before they achieve the critical mass necessary to kill thousands of us.  I know to whom my vote will be going.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

This marks a significant personal turning point for Kerry, and we at &lt;i&gt;Neutiquam Erro&lt;/i&gt; wish him the best of luck in the long and arduous recovery ahead of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading medical experts expressed surprise at the rapidity of the procedure, which was apparently accomplished by an intern throwing a standard football at Kerry&apos;s exposed neck.  Though doctors are optimistic about Kerry&apos;s recovery, at least one doctor warned that the possibiltiy of relapse will continue for as long as Kerry continues to, &quot;act like a jackass at every oppurtunity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kerry and campaign staffers declined to comment on the procedure, and refused to speculate whether this success indicates Kerry will be investigating related removals.  There has been much speculation in political circles that Kerry will go ahead with long-rumored plans to remove the stick from his ass as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In related news, Kerry&apos;s running mate, John Edwards, experienced severe trauma to his neck and lips during the procedure.  The injuries were described as, &quot;minor,&quot; and Edwards is expected to return to kissing Kerry&apos;s ass as soon as tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

<entry id='127' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2004://1.127' author_id='1' authored_on='20041009132000' basename='bush_did_better' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233138' modified_by='1' modified_on='20110502124612' ping_count='0' status='2' title='Bush Did Better This Time' week_number='200441'><text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2004c.html&quot;&gt;Finally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And secondly, it&apos;s a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden.  The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.  That&apos;s what the war on terror is about.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/archives/2004/10/remember.shtml&quot;&gt;I said it better&lt;/a&gt;, but it&apos;s nice to finally see Bush making this distinction, because it&apos;s a big one.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And so, what I&apos;m telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they&apos;re right.&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;/br /&gt;People love America.  Sometimes they don&apos;t like the decisions made by America, but I don&apos;t think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You go, W!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, forget all this talk about a draft.  We&apos;re not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He should have gone further with this - it&apos;s Kerry who seems hell-bent on increasing our military ranks.  The &apos;I&apos; needs to be in bold, italicized, underlined, and in eighty-point font.  And maybe blinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; should have made his point more explicit and forceful when rebutting this gem from Kerry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, I&apos;m going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I&apos;m going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I&apos;m going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of course, there are 40,000 Americans out there right now, saying to themselves, &quot;self, I think I&apos;ll join the military if Kerry is elected&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have a deficit. We have a deficit because this country went into a recession. You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped. And that cost us revenue. That cost us revenue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should have been said earlier, and louder, and more clearly.  Attacks on Bush consistently blame him for the recession from which we&apos;re currently recovering, but anyone who&apos;s not an idiot can trace it back to the irrational exuberance of the Clinton years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you&apos;re going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I&apos;m sorry, you too.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My jaw was on the floor as Kerry said that, and I was even more flabbergasted as I realized nobody in the room seemed to be offended.  If I looked around a crowded room and proclaimed that everybody there looked poor, I would consider it an insult.  Maybe it&apos;s just me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I own a timber company?  That&apos;s news to me.  Need some wood?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That belongs on a t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Embryonic stem-cell research requires the destruction of life to create a stem cell. I&apos;m the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research. I did to because I too hope that we&apos;ll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived.  But I think we&apos;ve got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s something I haven&apos;t ranted about before.  I must remember to do so at a future time.  Bottom line on my position: You&apos;ve got to draw a line somewhere, and it&apos;s pretty much got to be arbitrary.  If you&apos;ve read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060901012/qid=1097341988/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-7554419-5694221?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846&quot;&gt;Brave New World&lt;/a&gt;, try to imagine how they&apos;d handle stem cell research.  And then, hopefully, realize that that isn&apos;t the right way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='128' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2004://1.128' author_id='1' authored_on='20041010010800' basename='liberals_are_fu' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233138' modified_on='20080324233138' ping_count='0' status='2' title='Liberals Are Funny' week_number='200442'><text>&lt;p&gt;I just turned off Saturday Night Live.  I think it&apos;s probably in the best interest of my blood pressure not to watch again until a few months after the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept watching through the debate parodies.  They were unfair, but they were funny.  I sat through the &apos;Robert Smigel Cartoon&apos;.  Of course it was crap, but Robert Smigel is a filthy hippy and I have long since ceased to be surprised at the depths to which he will descend.  What finally caused me to shut of the TV was the skit featuring &apos;Queen Latifah&apos; as someone paid by the Bush campaign to bribe urban voters.  Frankly, that goes past humorous and enters solidly into slander territory (or is it libel...  I can never remember which is which).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, I know people who get their news from SNL&apos;s Weekend Update - and surprisingly, you used to be able to do that.  It used to be like the Daily Show used to be, the real story followed by a joke.  Now they&apos;ve abandoned all pretense of honesty.  The producers of SNL want you to vote for John Kerry.  Your enjoyment is at best a minor concern, as is the extent to which they will have to lie to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as long as I&apos;m ranting, who the &lt;i&gt;hell&lt;/i&gt; is &apos;Queen&apos; Latifah?  Queen of what?  Just another talentless nobody who&apos;s famous for being famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as long as I&apos;m as-long-as-I&apos;m-ing, I hope Rodney Dangerfield&apos;s family wasn&apos;t watching.  A funny tribute to a funny man would be a great thing.  A stupid tribute to a funny man is an insult.  &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; can do a better Dangerfield impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s interesting - SNL wasn&apos;t always so liberal.  I&apos;m not saying anybody on the staff ever voted Republican, but back when Dennis Miller or Norm MacDonald were hosting Weekend Update the show was pretty much equal-opportunity with the criticism.  And now, under Tina Fey, their ratings are in an upswing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina Fey.  Al Franken.  John Stewart.  All the popular comedians (comediennes) with a political agenda are liberals.  Yet plenty of their fans aren&apos;t at all liberal.  I can come to only one conclusion: liberals are funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&apos;m going to go find a pie and hit John Kerry in the face with it.  If he minds, he&apos;s not really a liberal, and his whole persona is a lie - so I won&apos;t be able to vote for him.  If he laughs it off, then he&apos;s clearly as liberal as can be - so I won&apos;t be able to vote for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a special added bonus, John Kerry will have pie all over his face.  He&apos;ll look &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; silly - so I won&apos;t be able to vote for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see no bad in this plan.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

It&apos;s about an American who works as a Nazi propaganda minister, who believes he&apos;s on an undercover mission for the Allies.  It&apos;s never really clear whether his employment by the good guys is real or imagined, and by the end of the novel he comes to the conclusion that it doesn&apos;t really matter, because he&apos;s guilty of war crimes either way.  Vonnegut wrote that the moral of the story is, &quot;we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be&quot;.  It&apos;s a good moral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I bring this up?  Because &lt;a href=&quot;http://randomfoo.net/?p=2004_10_00_archive.inc#crossfire&quot;&gt;obviously Jon Stewart never read &lt;i&gt;Mother Night&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Check the link out, they&apos;ve got a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Readers&apos; Digest version is that Stewart thinks Crossfire is a let-down, that they fall through on their responsibility to foster real political debate.  He accuses them of being party hacks, of not forcing politicians to answer the tough questions - but he has no good answer when the subject of his not-even-softball interview with Kerry comes up, and he seems flabbergasted and indignant that the program&apos;s hosts won&apos;t take him seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve got news for you, Jon: If a presidential candidate is on your show, and you&apos;ve sent people to the conventions, and you&apos;ve published a book, well: you&apos;re a real news show.  The prank-calling puppets are an excuse, and a poor one at that; If you sit behind a desk and ask Kerry how he&apos;s been instead of asking him a real question, you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a monkey, and it doesn&apos;t matter what network you&apos;re on.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Missing explosives.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Maybe Russia helped Saddam move them to Syria, maybe our military got there first and removed them, maybe the insurgents have them.  Whichever way, if these are WMD enough to be a big deal, then perhaps this war isn&apos;t the crock the Democrats would have us believe.  Further, any news organizations that would even &lt;i&gt;consider&lt;/i&gt; &apos;holding&apos; this story till election-eve shouldn&apos;t be paid any attention or given any credit.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Mary Cheney is a lesbian.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Who the hell cares?&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;New Al-Qaeda tape, maybe.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Again, holding things like this based on the proximity of the election is unconscionable.  I&apos;m looking at you, ABC.  I&apos;m not entirely convinced it&apos;s real, myself.  Give me a DV camcorder and a copy of Final Cut Pro - and a towel to wear over my head - and I could produce one just like it.  The noticable English fluency is a bit off-putting, to say the least.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;iPod photo.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I say to Apple about this what I said to &lt;a href=&quot;http://smartdisk.com/&quot;&gt;my former employers&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://smartdisk.com/Products/DigitalMultimedia/FlashTrax.asp&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;: I would never use one, and I don&apos;t know anyone who would.  But in Apple&apos;s defense, at least the iPod is a decent music player.&lt;/dd&gt;

I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; going to say that George W. Bush, for all his faults, has demonstrated a much broader willingness to put the safety of Americans first, whereas John Kerry has yet to demonstrate anything much grander than a burning yearning to be President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sort of problem with the electronic ballot systems here in Collier county; probably related to everybody in the county but me and my immediate family being mildly retarded.  But I&apos;m really not concerned, as Bush seems to be winning the state even without the substantial boost we&apos;ll likely provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current prediction has Bush ending up with nearly 300 electoral votes (290-something) and in the neighborhood of 57% of the popular vote.  We&apos;ll see how the tallies bear out my mentalics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;W&quot; src=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/images/W.jpg&quot; width=&quot;48&quot; height=&quot;48&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Updated 10:52 PM:&lt;/b&gt; Just flipped over to good &apos;ol Dan Rather for a laugh.  He just decided to call Pennsylvania for Kerry, apparently just so he could doomishly prophesy that Bush now needs both Florida and Ohio to win.  It really is amazing that he gets away this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not paying attention (and for tomorrow, when I&apos;ll have forgotten), at this point nobody has called any of those three states by CBS, and Florida is at this point a far clearer call than PA.  It&apos;s not that I object to calling PA for Kerry, because that&apos;s clearly where it&apos;s going, it&apos;s that I object to doing so merely for the thrill of spinning things his own way.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Fox called the election for Bush, and then Drudge called the election for Bush, then NBC called the election for Bush - though actually I beat them all to the punch.  But then John Edwards paraded out on stage, still grinning like a lobotomy patient, and declared that they weren&apos;t conceding.  So NBC basically retracted their prior sensible declaration, and Brokaw - repeating Edwards&apos; feeble protestations - mused on camera that if he waited four years he can wait a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find amazing is that Brokaw didn&apos;t even try to make it sound like that wasn&apos;t his personal position; I guess the hours are getting to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, once again, a democratic presidential candidate - a wooden, humorless man with no real track record and no appeal to anyone save for his party affiliation - loses to the better man.  And once again, that democrat refuses to give in to reality or sanity, and holds out for some absurd deus ex machina.  And once again, George W. Bush is clearly and legally elected as the President of the United States, while his opponent splashes mud on his legitamacy and thus ushers in four more years of baseless allegations of a stolen election or silent coup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Al Gore.  Thank you, John Kerry.  Thank you, Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the vaunted &apos;youth vote&apos;.  What the Kerry campaign seemed to miss is something good teachers figure out early on: kids are just little people.  If approximately half of the population as a whole is voting Republican, then the same is more-or-less true for those under 21 (or 35, or 18, or whatever cut-off we&apos;re using to describe this mythical bloc).  Folks in the Kerry camp, like known idiot Michael Moore, thought that they were energizing the youth vote, converting them, getting out the vote - the problem is that it&apos;s a futile exercise.  Just as is the case with the larger population, the youths most likely to be swayed by Puff Daddy in an insane t-shirt are also those least likely to show up at the polls.  If you&apos;re going to put your faith in your ability to mold human clay, you need to be aware that said clay will tend to flake out on you when you need them the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: Exit polls.  We had a clear demonstration of the uselessness of exit polling this November 2nd, right around noon-ish.  And yet we&apos;re still discussing them!  I&apos;m sick of hearing what percentage of the Hispanic vote went for whom.  The fact is, we don&apos;t really know.  If the figures being tossed around were trustworthy and accurate, then I guess Kerry won the election.  Which, despite some left-wing nut-jobs&apos; insistence in the affirmative, he most assuredly did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, talk of secession.  When you live in a democratic nation, you implicitly accept the will of the majority.  If you don&apos;t like it, leave.  You don&apos;t get to take New England with you.  And if I hear one more batty lefty telling us that all the red states supported slavery, I might just fly off the handle.  I&apos;m not sure what handle or how far I&apos;ll fly, but there will be a definite off-ward motion and flying of indeterminate distance in an unknown direction.  And I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t need to point out that when these states seceded from the Union, they were all being run by the Democratic party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Forgot this, but I wanted to get it in writing someplace.  Remember back when the media was promising a 5-15% boost for Kerry?  Kerry&apos;s supporters seem unhappy that it never materialized... I think they&apos;re wrong.  I suspect the 49% Kerry managed to muster would&apos;ve been around 40% without the Dan Rathers of the world trying to impose their will on the masses.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Interesting side note: whichever ocean is the center, the US has shoreline.  If I had more of a background in geopolitics, I&apos;d hypothesize that this is the real reason for the endurance of American relevancy.  If.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Today on Neutiquam Erro: Creationism vs. Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a fundamentally stupid battle this is.  The problem here, as it so often is elsewhere, can be summed up in one simply word: Dogma.  And I&apos;m not just looking at the Church here, because both sides are guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core ideas of these supposedly antithetical camps - that God created Man and  that all living creatures evolved over time - are not at all difficult to reconcile.  If one accepts the hypothesis that God created the universe, then it stands to reason that He also constructed the rules by which the universe plays - those quirky equations we call natural laws - and the initial arrangement of matter and energy in the universe, then it&apos;s not difficult to argue that all things that ever have or ever will come to pass were inherent in the rules of the games and the starting positions of the pieces.  This view seems to give even greater glory to God than traditional Creationist rhetoric; surely the accomplishment of crafting Adam pales before the triumph of arranging these intricate dominoes such that billions of trillions of years after the first one was nudged we&apos;re all sitting around debating the point?  What&apos;s more, it reconciles nicely with Darwinism; if evolution is indeed provable from first principles, then it too is inherent in the the rules of the game, and part and parcel of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the Creationist perspective - at its core a belief that God created Man - is that over the years it has become burdened with heavy layers of dogma, to the point where the essence of the argument is approximately as visible as God Himself.  Folks are taught in church and Sunday school that God wrote the bible, a difficult statement to swallow and a clear slight to Messrs. J, P, E, and D, as well as the Council of Nicea - and attempts to treat Biblical accounts as parables or allegories are generally termed heresy.  The Bible tells us that the universe took six days and then God took a day off, but it provides no indication of when He communicated that information to mankind.  This alone should provide adequate basis for inspecting the ideas independently of the ideology, because clearly the ideology can&apos;t even manage to be entirely self-consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with Darwinist camp - supporters of a scientific theory explaining biological differentiation and progression - is that to many it has become an article of faith rather than a scientific theory - so much so that its proponents have bolted on additional memes to bolster their crusade.  Darwin said nothing about the initial origin of life on Earth; that present proponents propose prepending the appearance of protoplasm from primordial prut is a perilous precedent.  This isn&apos;t the extension of the theory so much as it is the bolting together of two disparate theories into an ideological framework.  There&apos;s no scientific reason to connect these two theories; each is independently testable and each could be true independent of the other&apos;s veracity.  And for the record, Darwinism has no position on the origin of the universe - nor should it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like the only reason for this (ongoing) battle is that each side is intent on not only proving themselves to be right, but to be &apos;Right&apos;, and as a result they&apos;ve each expanded their ideological positioning into a pair of complete, competing frameworks.  And frankly, that&apos;s just dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

The topic is unimportant, but it was in response to a long, rambling, incoherent post and I think it did a fairly decent job of ripping the dweeb a new one. &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=28984&amp;cid=3113144&quot;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;If Morpheus can use the Gnutella network together with all their aparatus of media file meta-information, and multiple segmented downloading, and if they use the hyper-cube network approach, rather than the tree one, it will simply rocks, and no one will be able to stop it when it begins.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;And if pigs can fly, and I can ride one, and they fly me to hell, and it just froze over, and we all have ice cream...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not too long afterwards I discovered someone named Martin had adopted my quote as part of his signature, and even included a link to the original comment.  I was honored, of course, that a random stranger had found me worth quoting.  You can still find a couple (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cctec.com/maillists/nanog/historical/0211/msg00052.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/2002-03/msg00212.html&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) of Martin&apos;s messages cached on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now someone has taken my creative product and used it without proper attribution.  Witness &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expander.net/quotes.php&quot;&gt;some random quote page&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.screamingmonk.com/spudtarget.cfm&quot;&gt;some random random page&lt;/a&gt; (the quote in the masthead rotates, but trust me, it&apos;s there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I guess it&apos;s a compliment.  On the other hand, my ambitions towards supervillainy would seem to demand a swift and prejudicial reprisal.  What say you, six regular but largely-nonparcipitory and partially-anonymous readers?&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Because I&apos;m lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things going on - firstly, big huzzah for Google, as I&apos;ve moved up to the first result in a search for my name.  I&apos;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2004/05/success.shtml&quot;&gt;been here before&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess I shouldn&apos;t break out the champagne too soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other big news, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deltatao.com/&quot;&gt;Delta Tao&lt;/a&gt; (or more accurately, DT president &lt;a href=&quot;http://joedelta.com/&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt;) has re-opened canceled accounts in &lt;a href=&quot;http://clanlord.com/&quot;&gt;Clan Lord&lt;/a&gt;.  It&apos;s good to be back in Puddleby, and they&apos;ve made a lot of progress in the years since I quite - though it&apos;s somewhat depressing that so many of the old problems persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem with this &apos;throwing the doors open&apos; approach to re-invigorating the player base, of course, is that Skirwan is three years behind everyone else, which makes for depressing hunting.  I&apos;m undecided as to whether I&apos;ll stick around after the free time ends - but I&apos;d probably re-up in a second if a thousand ranks fell out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other news: Ward Churchill &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=14822&amp;only=yes&quot;&gt;isn&apos;t an Indian any more&lt;/a&gt;, but he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=14829_Churchill_Teaches_Terrorism&amp;only=yes&quot;&gt;still an idiot&lt;/a&gt;.  Democrats think Karl Rove is &lt;a href=&quot;http://timblair.net/ee/index.php/weblog/roves_brilliant_plan/&quot;&gt;the boogeyman&lt;/a&gt;, which would be funnier if I hadn&apos;t just heard this tinfoilhattery coming out of my own Grandfather&apos;s mouth a week ago.

&lt;p&gt;These folks claim to know with 100% certainty that the woman is mentally dead, and they support this claim with EEGs showing that her cerebral cortex is no longer functioning.  Unfortunately all they&apos;ve really proved is that her cerebral cortex is no longer functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s be honest: nobody understands the human brain.  We associate functions with various brain structures, but we know that in the case of a severe injury different parts of the brain can adapt to maintain necessary functions.  Blind people use the visual centers of their brains to help with their navigation, despite having no visual input.  Test animals have been neurologically rewired such that they see with the section of their brain that normally handles sound.  Individuals with massive trauma destroying large tracts of cerebral tissue continue to function normally.  Again and again we see that brain functionality isn&apos;t set in stone, that the brain can adapt to injury by reallocating its structures to different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the author of this diatribe &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that Ms. Schiavo&apos;s remaining brain tissue has not cobbled together some semblance of a consciousness?  No, she doesn&apos;t.  She can&apos;t even properly define what a consciousness is or what sentience means, because if she could we&apos;d all have heard of her.  I&apos;ll admit that it&apos;s extremely unlikely, but there is - as far as we twenty-first century humans know - a chance that some part of the cognitive patterns making up Ms. Schiavo mind still exist in some form.  Dr. Elizabeth M. Whelan is seriously irresponsible in writing this article; to say what she says with any degree of authority would require technology and understanding that is simply not in modern man&apos;s possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said: No, I&apos;m not claiming that this is definitely (or even probably) the case; I&apos;ve not met Ms. Schiavo, I have no medical background, and as someone totally uninvolved in the issue I feel I lack standing to hold a strong opinion either way.  But Dr. Whelan is just as guilty of junk science as the those she attacks, and if there&apos;s one thing I can&apos;t stand it&apos;s a hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Well, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mccain.senate.gov/&quot;&gt;miserable failure&lt;/a&gt; who brought us that miserable failure has done it again: a &apos;compromise&apos; in which Democrats retain the &apos;right&apos; to the filibuster, and the Senate finally manages to vote on three - &lt;i&gt;just three!&lt;/i&gt; - judicial candidates.  Someone ought to explain to McCain that in a &lt;i&gt;compromise&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;both sides get something&lt;/i&gt;!  This isn&apos;t compromise, this is the lunatic-fringe-anti-democratic-tinfoil-hat-crowd winning, flat out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A democracy requires voting, and it requires that all involved agree to abide by the outcome of the vote.  Suing for a recount is not democratic.  Permanently stalling to prevent the vote is not democratic.  Maybe someday the democrats will spend some of their soft-money donations on something useful, and &lt;i&gt;buy a fucking clue&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

A rather bad one.  I think I have an infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m taking antibiotics and Orajel.  They seem to be helping, but I&apos;m a bit more loopy than normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&apos;s a semi-loopy statement that will someday turn out to be world-shatteringly important:  the reason the laws of physics don&apos;t seem to imply any particular &apos;flow&apos; of time is that temporal velocity is implicit in all the equations modern physics has worked out; because everything we can continually observe is moving in time at the same velocity as we are, we&apos;ve never noticed that most of our constants should actually have a time factor in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the big bang, or whatever started the universe, matter started moving with a range of different spatial velocities; we already can be fairly sure about that.  What we haven&apos;t figured out yet is that matter also launched from the big bang with a range of different &lt;i&gt;temporal&lt;/i&gt; velocities.&lt;/p&gt;

I suppose it&apos;s a valid question, but that&apos;s not what caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;How do the adults feel about us moving in? What if I find a Caucasian girl and decide to date her?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asks the 36-year-old black man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that for a minute.  The 36-year-old wonder what the adults think of him, and worries about dating a white a girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve got to wonder, Mr. Andrew, at what point you stop worrying what the adults think and start thinking for yourself as an adult.  And I won&apos;t even bother suggesting that instead of &apos;deciding to date a Caucasian girl&apos; you find a nice &lt;i&gt;woman&lt;/i&gt; - whatever flavor you like - and convince &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; to date &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&apos;m jumping all over a poorly-contextualized statement likely delivered extemporaneously.  But the fact that this attitude can exist - the thirty-six-year-old &lt;i&gt;kid&lt;/i&gt; - seems to me to be symptomatic of a far greater problem.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;And eventually God decided it was the time for the &quot;it&apos;s just not working out&quot; talk, possibly to be followed by the &quot;it&apos;s not you it&apos;s me&quot; segue into the &quot;I hope we can still be friends&quot; line.  The problem is, of course, that God, being God, had a hard time communicating with mortals - hence the burning bushes and such.  But God felt pretty strongly that this was the kind of discussion that He needed to have in person, so he arranged a way to be mortal enough to walk Earth as a man, sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once He was here, He started to notice things He hadn&apos;t seen from above.  He came to love humanity, despite our numerous manifest flaws, and He started to feel like maybe we all could do with another chance or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course even God has to follow the rules - not because they bind Him, of course, but because God is one of the good guys and the good guys follow the rules (it makes it easy to tell them apart from the bad guys).  So humanity was due for some pretty severe discipline, and there really wasn&apos;t a way out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the almost-mortal God (who was going by &apos;Jesus&apos; because introducing yourself as God tends to meet with polite skepticism in even the most accepting company) decided He could take the punishment for us.  And so He did.  And, by the look of things, it was none too pleasant.  But because Jesus took our medicine for us, we got off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s Christianity in a nutshell.  We screwed up, we had a whuppin&apos; coming, and Jesus stepped up and took one for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if it&apos;s only a story,  you can still ask yourself &quot;what would Jesus do?&quot; and it&apos;s a useful question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t expect to see it before early March, so I doubt I&apos;ll get the chance to claim the &lt;a href=&quot;http://windowsxp.onmac.net/The%20Contest.html&quot;&gt;nearly $10K&lt;/a&gt; bounty on Windows XP compatibility, which is sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to some of the clamor about this, I&apos;m forced to the conclusion that a lot of people are just very, very dumb.  For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://neosmart.net/blog/dual-booting-windows-xp-on-a-macbook/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by some guy nobody&apos;s ever heard of is being hailed like it&apos;s the second coming or something... but it&apos;s really kinda silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, for instance, step nine -- &quot;Use the Bootable Vista DVD to boot on the MacBook&quot;.  The far more clever folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/index.ars&quot;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/imac-coreduo.ars/7&quot;&gt;already tried that&lt;/a&gt;.  You can&apos;t boot from a DVD that the computer won&apos;t boot from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s just the most glaring. Step 16 is the sort of thing I&apos;d expect to find in a business plan written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpants_Gnomes&quot;&gt;underpants gnomes&lt;/a&gt; -- It&apos;s like writing &quot;and then a miracle occurs&quot; when you&apos;re detailing a chemical reaction.  Step eight is just as dumb as step nine, unless you assume he means to do that on a separate PC... but if you&apos;re doing all this on a separate PC you might as well just boot from another drive and do this all booted in Windows or some flavor of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to figuring all this out would be getting an open source bootloader (probably grub) working.  Worrying about faking MBRs and chaining unperfected bootloaders from beta operating systems is putting the cart before the horse.  The (Intel) man pages for hdiutil, bless, and nvram would be helpful, and I&apos;m rather dismayed they haven&apos;t shown up on the web yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah well.  I&apos;d rather have something like QEMU anyway -- dual-booting is such a pain.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Things went about as well as could be expected; I had to reconfigure Apache and Postfix, I had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060111113313511&quot;&gt;keep MySQL and PHP talking&lt;/a&gt;, a few things didn&apos;t &apos;stick&apos; until I toggled them off and on a few times (including, bewilderingly, sshd).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most surprising part of the whole experience wasn&apos;t anything on the server at all, it was Safari on my soon-to-be-replaced PowerBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after getting things partially back up, I pulled out my laptop and checked various things out, including Movable Type.  Because the various document roots weren&apos;t configured yet, Safari was understandably unable to load the images, CSS files, and JavaScript files used in the MT user interface.  That&apos;s pretty easy to forgive, seeing as the fault was with the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strangeness came after the server was properly reconfigured: when I logged in to MT on my laptop, everything still looked like garbage.  When I brought up the activity window (cmd-opt-a), 90% of it wasn&apos;t loaded!  And yet when I opened a new browser window and typed in the URL to that resource, it loaded just fine.  If I hit the reload button enough, eventually a single page of the MT UI would start to look okay -- except the next page would be back to looking like crap, unable to find the same blasted CSS file I had just managed to convince the previous page to load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m still not really sure where the problem is.  It could be that Safari is checking the revision dates from headers and deciding that the the 404 error pages it saw last time are still current, it could be that Safari&apos;s cache is just stupid, it could be that Safari&apos;s cache on this particular computer is corrupted...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very odd.  I finally broke down and emptied the cache, and now all is right with the world -- except for the fact that everything loads slowly and will continue to do so for a few weeks at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;She&apos;s almost right.  Republicans are playing the &lt;i&gt;terror&lt;/i&gt; card.  As in, &quot;Hey, look at those terrorists!  Aren&apos;t you glad we have an army?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that Democrats don&apos;t want to be scared.  Being scared is no fun -- in fact it&apos;s the exact opposite of fun.  It&apos;s supposed to be uncomfortable -- it&apos;s a complex evolved behavior that creates mental discomfort and motivates us to avoid or alter the situation that&apos;s scaring us.  There&apos;s a &lt;i&gt;point&lt;/i&gt; to fear - and that point is to get us off our asses and paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sez Miz Clinton: &quot;You cannot explain to me why we have not captured or killed the tallest man in Afghanistan&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I can: because he&apos;s simply not a priority.  Osama bin Laden is not magic.  He cannot fly, he cannot fire laser beams out of his eyes, and his ability to breathe fire is suspect as well.  Capturing Osama bin Laden would have no greater tactical benefit than capturing any other high-ranking Al Qaeda member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Qaeda is not a corporation, with the CEO making the tough calls.  It isn&apos;t an army, with the General deciding on the battle plan.  Al Qaeda is a distributed network -- yeah, just like those distributed networks you use to pirate MP3s.  And the thing about distributed networks is that cutting off their head really doesn&apos;t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hillary&apos;s comment shows her to be of the same mind as Kerry (read the last two paragraphs of &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/archives/2004/10/remember.shtml&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;).  She sees the war on terror as revenge for 9/11, so clearly capturing Osama is the priority.  Or perhaps she sees the war on terrorism as a way to placate the bloodlust of we idiot Christian rednecks, and that&apos;s why capturing Osama is a priority.  It&apos;s really hard to say what Hillary Clinton believes, because her opinion changes every time a new poll comes in.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

It&apos;s an interesting experience in a number of ways, and I really ought to stop being lazy and write about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, if any other Mac user out there in Google-land is using Visual Studio .NET 2005 in Windows 2000 under Virtual PC 6.1, the trick to stop the random crashes is to disable the &apos;vshost&apos; debugging introduced in VS.NET 2005.  Just bring up the project properties, go to the &apos;Debug&apos; pane, and uncheck &apos;Enable the Visual Studio hosting process&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSHost sounds quite a lot like the &apos;fix and continue&apos; feature Apple added to Xcode a few versions back.  It seems to work just about as well.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='170' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2006://1.170' author_id='1' authored_on='20060217003300' basename='net_from_a_mac' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233142' modified_on='20080324233142' ping_count='0' status='2' title='.NET From a Mac Perspective' week_number='200607'><text>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m currently taking a course in .NET programming.  It has been -- and continues to be -- an interesting experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been a Mac guy for as long as I&apos;ve been using computers.  I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; use Windows, and in fact I get paid to do so on occasion, but for my own purposes I avoid Windows like the plague.  Nonetheless, it&apos;s nothing dogmatic with me -- unlike some Mac users, I don&apos;t feel like we need to wage a holy war against Redmond.  The world has far too many Jihads ongoing already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my familiarity with Windows, my programming experience has been uniformly Mac- and *nix- based.  I&apos;m familiar enough with MFC to recognize when a program is the result of a severely lazy developer overusing it, but not enough to actually create a Win32 binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; First Impressions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, Visual Studio is a very nice IDE.  Microsoft&apos;s code completion -- &apos;Intellisense&apos; -- is very well done.  If I&apos;m working with strings, Visual Studio can show me the various manipulation methods about as quickly as Xcode can show me the selectors for an NSString -- despite the fact that &lt;i&gt;Visual Studio is running in emulation&lt;/i&gt;.  Apple really needs to get their ass in gear on that count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Windows Forms Designer, to put things simply, sucks.  It&apos;s like somebody looked at HyperCard but never got to actually use it, and then went off to clone it.  If you want to change the text in a label, you need to view its properties and type into a tiny little box -- if you just double-click expecting to edit the text, it brings up your source file and lets you write a procedure to be invoked... &lt;i&gt;when the user clicks on your label&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s right: &lt;i&gt;when the user clicks on your label&lt;/i&gt;.  The reason that so many Windows apps have crummy UIs is suddenly becoming more clear to me.  It&apos;s a pretty basic fact of consistent UI design that labels don&apos;t actually do anything; the fact that the default path in Microsoft&apos;s standard development tool makes them into buttons is, to say the least, alarming.  Making things work the wrong way should never be the default behavior -- in fact, doing something as nonstandard as this should be bloody hard work that only the most dedicated hackers could pull off&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also interesting with Windows Forms is the inability to decouple control from view (a la MVC).  Each form (which in the real world we call a &apos;window&apos;) is an object, and each UI element is configured to execute a method of this object as it&apos;s manipulated.  I&apos;m not saying this is &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;, per se, but it takes some getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of things that take some getting used to, these form objects are also in charge of creating the windows and UI elements they control.  Unlike the Mac, where windows are generated by system calls based on data files (either resources with the Toolbox or Nibs in Carbon or Cocoa), the Windows Form Designer just generates code and inserts it into your source file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see benefits both ways.  The biggest problem with the Windows method is that it isn&apos;t hard to get the two out-of-sync to the point where things become difficult, so you&apos;re better off just leaving the generated code alone -- which begs the question, why is the code generated at all?  Why doesn&apos;t the form editor just directly produce the MSIL and hand it to the compiler to insert into your binary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come.  Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Disappointing' week_number='200609'><text>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve got to say, today&apos;s big product announcements from Apple are something of a let-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Great Big Hype... Itty-Bitty Desk Space&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big news is obviously the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macmini/&quot;&gt;Intel Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;.  It&apos;s better in some respects -- a faster processor never hurts, and the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macmini/frontrow.html&quot;&gt;Front Row&lt;/a&gt;, with the ability to stream video from other Macs on the network, seems to adequately equip the Mini to reside in the living room, as the last outpost of your so-called iLife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the dream starts to fall apart pretty quickly; Apple&apos;s remote is proprietary and undocumented, so you&apos;re not going to be controlling your Mini with a universal remote.  It&apos;s also not open to developers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoadev.com/index.pl?UsingTheAppleRemoteControl&quot;&gt;not that that will stop anybody&lt;/a&gt;), which means we&apos;re unlikely to see the fine folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://elgato.com/&quot;&gt;El Gato&lt;/a&gt; joining the party any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m also concerned with the video output quality; for folks with HDMI or DVI connectors on their HDTVs life may be sweet, but those of us still living in S-Video land have to use an adaptor, which historically results in a picture that looks almost but not quite entirely like crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intel Killed the Radio Star&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the jump from a PPC to an Intel Core chip, the new Minis also made another Intel jump -- they drop the ATI chip that had provided video to the previous generation, and move to one of Intel&apos;s integrated graphics chips.  I&apos;m up in the air about this one; on the one hand, the modern Intel graphics chips don&apos;t really deserve their terrible reputations -- they can scroll text as prettily as anything else you&apos;d find.  And obviously Apple&apos;s gotten Core Image and Core Video to work with them (we know this from the developer test machines, which ran an Intel integrated video chip as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem is gaming, and this is where I&apos;m torn.  It&apos;s unlikely you&apos;ll have a good time playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldofwarcraft.com/&quot;&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt; on the new Minis, but on the other hand most people who buy a Mini have no interest in WoW.  Most folks who want to game on their Mac are students, who tend to hit the iBooks (or MacBooks, as they&apos;ll doubtless be called) and iMacs, or random geeks like myself who will gravitate towards the MacBook Pros and whatever replaces the Power Mac line.  And those are all great machines for gaming.  The target audience for the Mini -- at least as far as I can tell -- are the folks who&apos;ll spend most of their time in Mail, Safari, iPhoto, and iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem is probably one of expectation; the fact that the new generation can&apos;t do (or won&apos;t do as well) something the previous generation did adequately will rankle some, and the traditional Mac-user-bitching-echo-chamber will ensure that &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; hears about it.  It&apos;s one of those situations where either choice was wrong, and I guess I can&apos;t fault Apple for staying on-message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;iPod, uPod, wePod... No, from now on only iPod&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big news -- where by &apos;big&apos; I mean &apos;small&apos; and by &apos;news&apos; I mean &apos;grab for cash&apos; -- is Apple&apos;s foray into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A13FD3D5A0C708CDDAB0894DE404482&quot;&gt;purportedly billion-dollar&lt;/a&gt; iPod-accessory industry.  On the one hand, it&apos;s only fair that they grab a slice of the pie that they baked.  On the other hand, these new products aren&apos;t really much to write home about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hi, Fi!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipodhifi/&quot;&gt;iPod Hi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; has got to be the most God-awful ugly product Apple has ever produced.  And remember, kids, I used to have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tarosworld.com/apple/old_peripherals/portrait/&quot;&gt;Apple Portrait Display&lt;/a&gt;!  They can talk all they want about how great the sound quality is, but that&apos;s not going to sell to most folks -- I can&apos;t &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; a web page, and most stores are too noisy to even hear the salesperson (thank God).  And the &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt; audiophile set -- the kind who prefer vinyl because it&apos;s &apos;warmer&apos; and like vaccuum-tube speakers because they&apos;re &apos;costlier&apos; -- aren&apos;t going to be caught &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt; with an iPod.  They have far too much ego invested in believing they&apos;re better than we compressed-music-listening plebeian cretins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mooo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=MA398G/A&quot;&gt;leather case for my iPod&lt;/a&gt;?  Wow, neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hundred bucks?  Hey, look, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=M9720G/A&quot;&gt;iPod socks&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The FedEx Fairy left boxes!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean was so happy that he did that growling-squinting thing that almost resembles a human smile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Either happy or preparing to bit your neck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean was sad, because the pictures taken by his cell phone camera are &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; lousy.  But then Sean had an idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, doesn&apos;t this new MacBook have a camera built in?&quot; said Sean.  And sure enough, it did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;And *crack* went the lense!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very cool.  It was so cool that Sean&apos;s brain began to overheat!  And his head began to melt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PhotoBooth is a wonderful waste of time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;These pictures are so much better than the first two!&quot; said Sean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re dead to me, cell phone!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;It shall sleep with the fishes!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Poor Mr. MacBook Pro can see everything but himself!&quot;  noticed Sean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made Sean sad, so Sean decided to help Mr. MacBook Pro out.  Sean took Mr. MacBook Pro to the magic mirror in the enchanted hallway by the front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;It is a very bright screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here you are, Mr. MacBook Pro!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then, a radiation wave hit, and Sean and Mr. MacBook Pro got shot through a Wormhole!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I am not John Crichton&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Sean is on a living ship full of strange alien life forms.  But that is a story for another day!&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;The screen really is pretty bright.  I&#8217;m typing this in bed while watching TV (laziness is an &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt;) and I just turned the brightness down - it was hurting my eyes to flick back and forth between the TV and the far-brighter MacBook LCD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fit and finish seem fine.  I&#8217;ll admit to a bit of trepidation on buying a first revision &lt;s&gt;PowerBook&lt;/s&gt; MacBook &#8212; having personally watched the battery fall out of a first-revision 17&#8221; PowerBook &#8212; but thus far my fears have proven unwarranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The built-in iSight connects (internally) via USB rather than FireWire, and thus seems to avoid the compatibility problems that have plagued its big brother.  It retains the tendency towards yellow casts in uneven lighting, however.  The microphone is pretty lousy, but it&#8217;s also about the size of the head of a pin so I think I&#8217;ll cut Apple some slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MagSafe system is very nice thus far.  I worried briefly after reading some initial reports saying that it detached far too easily, but again my fears have proven unfounded.  The MagSafe plug is actually rather difficult to remove when you either pull straight out or at an angle horizontally - it&#8217;s only in response to vertical tension that it pops out.  I&#8217;m really not sure how this will work out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider trackpad is very nice (wider than my old 15&#8221; 500 Mhz Titanium, at least) as is the two-fingered drag-to-scroll thing it does.  I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some proper InterCapped trademarked name for this, but I don&#8217;t happen to know it.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='174' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2006://1.174' author_id='1' authored_on='20060312222100' basename='mvc_musings' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233142' modified_on='20080324233142' ping_count='0' status='2' title='MVC Musings' week_number='200611'><text>&lt;p&gt;Code Musings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/Clieunk/&quot;&gt;Clieunk Devlog&lt;/a&gt; has some updates.  I&#8217;m trying to keep all specifically Clieunk-related stuff there, so any folks who are just interested in Clieunk don&#8217;t have to read my main blog here and put up with my occasional political ranting.  But for more general programming topics not uniquely relating to Clieunk, I figure this is a decent wall on which to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MVC, Cocoa, and C++&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Model/View/Controller design pattern is a common one for a very good reason: it works quite well.  Not incidentally, the entirety of Apple&#8217;s AppKit framework (Cocoa) is built with MVC in mind.  The net result is that if you&#8217;re planning to write good Mac &lt;acronym title=&quot;Operating System&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/acronym&gt; X software you should at least understand the basics of MVC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that while Objective-C (the preferred language for Cocoa development) is excellent for view and controller classes, it has some rather serious shortcomings with respect to models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not My Type&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had to sum up C++ in three words, I&#8217;d suggest that they be &#8220;strong type checking&#8221;.  C++ has about the strictest typing of any of the popular mainstream languages, as well as a rich gallery of language features &#8212; most notably templates, the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; specifier, and a rich and well-defined set of object operators &#8212; that support this paradigm.  The end result is that C++ is absolutely incredible for defining data types, but sometimes a bit of a pain for designing other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love Objective-C++&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective-C++ is the best of both worlds, with a few caveats.  Firstly, it kills bindings, which are a really nice language feature but can&#8217;t be made to bridge between C++ models and Cocoa views.  Secondly, you lose (to some extent) the extensibility that makes Cocoa so truly neat to work with &#8212; you can load a bundle into an Objective-C++ application and tinker with the Cocoa code (headers  often provided via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codethecode.com/Projects/class-dump/&quot;&gt;class-dump&lt;/a&gt;) but you can&#8217;t easily affect the C++ model classes.  I ultimately decided that neither one of these drawbacks bothered me overmuch for Clieunk, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bindings would be nice in the early stages of the project, but since nearly every view in the program will be a custom job eventually, the net gains aren&#8217;t as huge as they might seem.  All the same, it would be very cool if someone could figure out a way to bind an &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;NSTableView&lt;/span&gt; to a &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;std::vector&amp;lt;std:string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second drawback, upon further consideration, actually turned out to be a benefit.  The reason I haven&#8217;t gone and posted Pixunk (my CL_Images browser) publicly is because I&#8217;m reasonably sure Ann would start to actively make my life miserable if I did so, and I have no desire to fight a war at this juncture.  If Clieunk were written entirely in Objective-C, it would be fairly straightforward to turn it into an image browser simply by creating an input manager that attaches to it.  This will probably still be possible in an Objective-C++ Clieunk, but the work required to do such a thing is on the same order of magnitude as just figuring out the image file format and writing a browser from scratch, so I wouldn&#8217;t feel too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&#8217;ve Got a Unit Test For You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel I&#8217;d be remiss in cheerleading for strong typing without responding to the recent popular meme about unit testing being superior to strong typing, as exemplified in a widely read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artima.com/intv/strongweakP.html&quot;&gt;interview with the creator of Python&lt;/a&gt;.  And I &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be remiss, so I&#8217;ll write about that sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My position, in a nutshell, is that preferring unit testing to strong typing is like preferring seat belts to an airbag: firstly, I really would rather have both; and secondly, stupid people can choose not to use the first, but the latter is basically forced upon them.  More next time, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

It isn&#8217;t even a service.  It&#8217;s a platform.  The Clan Lord server and client software do absolutely nothing of value on their own &#8212; the fun of the game stems entirely from the content, which nowadays is produced primarily (if not entirely) by unpaid volunteers.  This puts DT in an unusual but certainly not unique position.  And there are certain things that a company in this position needs to do if they wish to continue operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most important step is to recognize that you are dependent on others, and that you need to present yourself as a beggar rather than a chooser.  If you&#8217;re not going to provide direct incentives for the content-creators, then you need to do everything in your power to remove any disincentives: make the tools free and friendly, suck up to all your content-creators as though they&#8217;re the most important, and generally do everything in your power to make the act of creating content for your platform as painless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft understands this; you can download a copy of Visual Studio Express for free, and if just about every school with a programming course can join the &lt;acronym title=&quot;Microsoft Developer Network&quot;&gt;MSDN&lt;/acronym&gt; student network and hand out free copies of all Microsoft products to their student base.  And let&#8217;s not forget the image of Ballmer jumping around like a monkey chanting &#8220;developers, developers, developers&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple understands this; Mac &lt;acronym title=&quot;Operating System&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/acronym&gt; X is nothing but a shiny file browser without applications, so they distribute a copy of the development tools with every copy of the &lt;acronym title=&quot;Operating System&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/acronym&gt;, and make them available for free download to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun understands this; you can download and install Java for free and get everything you need to start developing right there in the zip file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogger understands this; you can set up a blog for free and start writing about your cat in just about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LiveJournal understands this; it probably takes even less than ten minutes to set up a journal and start writing about your wholly-imaginary sexual escapades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list could go on.  All of these companies recognize that their products (Windows, Mac &lt;acronym title=&quot;Operating System&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/acronym&gt; X, Java, Blogger.com, LiveJournal.com) are merely platforms, and that they depend on third parties to provide the content.  And, recognizing this situation, they go out of their way to make it easy to provide content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this isn&#8217;t to say that they like all the content that&#8217;s produced.  Not every Java applet gets linked to from the Sun homepage.  Not every shareware tools gets licensed and bundled with new Macs.  Not every promising software vendor gets purchased by Microsoft and gutted.  But all the same, the more people you have trying to produce great content, the more likely you are to actually have some produced.  If Apple had decided a few years back that QuarkXPress was the only page layout program their platform would ever need and had prevented anyone else from working on one, we&#8217;d never have gotten InDesign.  If Microsoft had stopped distributing developer tools, we&#8217;d be stuck with Internet Explorer instead of FireFox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare these platforms with &lt;acronym title=&quot; Operating System/2&quot;&gt;OS/2&lt;/acronym&gt; or BeOS:  the tools to develop for &lt;acronym title=&quot; Operating System/2&quot;&gt;OS/2&lt;/acronym&gt; were difficult (read: costly) to obtain, as was the documentation, and look where that got them; the BeOS development toolchain was (initially) tied to Metrowerks CodeWarrior, a rather pricey piece of commercial software.  Seen anyone running a BeBox lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta Tao doesn&#8217;t appear to have learned this lesson yet.  I was at once point told by &#8216;Small GM&#8217; that &#8220;[b]ecoming a GM is harder and suckier than becoming a mystic&#8221;&#8230; exactly one sentence after she admitted that, &#8220;&#8230; we NEED people to go through the frustration of becoming scripters and GMs. Because we really don&#8217;t have enough active ones.&#8221;  Eldon also continually oscillates between complaining about the lack of content creators and patiently explaining that we players are all too dumb to accomplish anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net result is that content creation is too slow, players are insufficiently entertained, and the player base shrinks.  It&#8217;s been happening since the moment I started playing, and it though the loss decelerates over time in absolute terms (though I suspect it&#8217;s fairly constant in percentage terms) it never really stops over extended periods.  Sooner or later, the subscription fees will be insufficient to pay for the bandwidth consumed and the game will vanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, people have been predicting this since day one.  Yes, Clan Lord is still here.  But the fact that this death is a slow and drawn-out one doesn&#8217;t make it any less final &#8212; and, unless something changes &#8212; inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='176' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2006://1.176' author_id='1' authored_on='20060323165000' basename='v_for_vendetta' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233142' modified_on='20080324233142' ping_count='0' status='2' title='V for Vendetta' week_number='200612'><text>&lt;p&gt;I just saw &lt;i&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/i&gt;.  I&#8217;m having a hard time determining what I thought of it.  The following ramble will give away all the good bits, so if you&#8217;re going to see the film I&#8217;d suggest doing so before reading further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some background: I just read the comics a few days ago, and &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; them &#8212; right up there with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen&quot;&gt;Watchmen&lt;/a&gt;, in my book &#8212; so obviously my take on the film is somewhat distorted.  But all the same, I have to major objections to the film version, and I think they&#8217;re more-or-less valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there&#8217;s the politics.  The comic is in the aftermath of some sort of global thermonuclear exchange, resulting in extreme climactic changes and widespread chaos; following a few years of miserable anarchy, a group of proto-fascists take charge in Great Britain and start to build their sort of society &#8212; which, incidentally, has very little room for ethnic or religious minorities or homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie throws all that out the window.  The ruling party in the film version brought itself to power by engineering massive biological attacks on their own soil, fostering a climate of fear in which their leader &#8212; a devoutly religious man, as the maddening omniscient voiceover informs us &#8212; can take control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What irks me is that this change is wholly gratuitous, and servers only to provide the mandated minimum amount of thinly-veiled Bush-bashing for a modern Hollywood production.  It&#8217;s hard to like a pointless alteration with no justification aside from furthering the mindless paranoid vitriol that passes for political thought in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second substantive complaint concerns the ending: I know Natalie Portman has a very pretty face, and yes it would be a shame to cover it up, but for God&#8217;s sake the story &lt;i&gt;needs&lt;/i&gt; her to don the mask!  In the comic, V&#8217;s dying words instruct Evey that she, &#8220;must discover whose face lies behind this mask, but [that she] must &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; know [his] face&#8221;.  Of course, Evey soon realizes that this statement isn&#8217;t a puzzle but a riddle, and dons the Guy Fawkes mask herself to lead the masses in their final assault on the corrupted government.  Evey, of course, slips out early &#8212; to save a young stranger and bring him to the Shadow Gallery in much the same manner as she herself began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious suggestion in the comic is that this young man will eventually become the next V when Evey&#8217;s part of the task is complete &#8212; and also leave the reader wondering whether V is really the first V, the original victim of room five.  What truly galls me is that this question is really a closed one in the comics &#8212; the issue is definitely settled when V fulfills the dying wish of the female doctor and shows her his face.  That dying wish is &lt;i&gt;missing&lt;/i&gt; in the film, giving me an hour of elation until the ending and the crushing realization that change was not the setup for an improved ending but a non-sequitur before a disappointingly straight-forward finale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, for all my ranting, I think it&#8217;s a good movie &#8212; as long as you can keep in mind that the politics are drivel.  Hugo Weaving is probably getting to be right up there with Christopher Walken on the list of inexplicably cool actors.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

It&#8217;s actually rather funny that people are so mystified by his energy policy&#8230; &lt;i&gt;How can he let gas prices get so high?&lt;/i&gt; they wonder.  &lt;i&gt;Why doesn&#8217;t he encourage alternative fuel sources?!&lt;/i&gt; they scream.  You can&#8217;t find an answer, my friends, because your questions are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&#8217;t make substantial changes to society just by signing a law.  Americans &#8212; and indeed humans in general &#8212; don&#8217;t like being told what to do.  You can&#8217;t shift us away from an oil-driven society just by deciding that we&#8217;re not going to use oil anymore, because a large portion of the population will immediately inevitably move to stop your plan from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to making people do what you want is to make them want the same thing.  If you want people to stop driving gas-guzzling road hogs, what better technique than to let gas prices continue to rise?  If you want to see the development of alternative energy sources, what better method than to create a climate where basic market forces provide all the impetus any &lt;acronym title=&quot;Chief Executive Officer&quot;&gt;CEO&lt;/acronym&gt; could ever need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But Sean&lt;/i&gt; you say, &lt;i&gt;if Chimpy McHalliburton really is pursuing that sort of plan, why hasn&#8217;t he told us about it?&lt;/i&gt;  Because if he did, the plan wouldn&#8217;t work.  Duh.  This school of manipulation &#8212; the &#8216;make them think it&#8217;s their idea school&#8217; &#8212; is entirely dependent on your quarry never realizing they&#8217;re being played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why am I telling you this?  Because there isn&#8217;t the slightest chance in hell that you&#8217;ll believe me.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m not going to do that anymore.  With each new post it is simply to be inferred by the reader that I&#8217;ve delayed inexcusably and that my worth as a human being is therefore forfeit.  There, now it&#8217;s on &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; shoulders.  See how &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving right along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve started a new job.  It&#8217;s new enough that I don&#8217;t really think I should be linking to it yet, but it involves developing web-based applications that are used by a rather substantial number of people.  To give a sense of scale, today I was trying to find the proper cutoff point past which the new reporting system would require reports to be delivered offline rather than on-demand.  The current guess is 8,000 submissions.  For some of our accounts this is a terribly low and uninspiring number and I shall shortly be endeavoring (by way of the black magic that men know as dynamic &lt;acronym title=&quot;Structured Query Language&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/acronym&gt;) to raise it rather significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who know me will be endlessly amused to hear that we&#8217;re a pure-Microsoft shop, and that I spend my days laboring in Visual Studio 2003.  They&#8217;ll likely be likewise tickled to hear how hopefully I anticipate our impending immersion into a relaxing rinse of ASP.NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005 (with a big ol&#8217; chunk of &lt;acronym title=&quot;Structured Query Language&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/acronym&gt; Server 2005 floating in the center like some sort of insane iceberg embedding execution of inline common-language code).  I for one find the whole matter deeply depressing and more than a little disturbing.  It&#8217;s like booting my MacBook into XP, but, like, with my &lt;i&gt;life&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really feel like I should say something political to wind this down.  I usually try to write at least one sentence in every post that would drive some of my more moonbatty friends and family up the wall&#8230;  Hrm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Statistically speaking, Ann Coulter is probably smarter than you.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How&#8217;s that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jigging Zo, signing off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Random post-script: That fifth paragraph really turned out nicely.  All that alliteration amps my attitude.  And if a single human being on the face of the planet manages to elucidate the erratic etymological elisions leading inevitably to the above intentionally inscrutable inscription, I&#8217;ll have to either propose marriage or track you down and kill you &#8212; I cannot abide duplicates!&lt;/div&gt;</text></entry>

My sole source for tales from the outside world is a television in a glass-walled conference room &#8212; I pass the room frequently, and as I pass I&#8217;m able to catch a momentary glimpse of either CNN or MSNBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think, from the headlines displayed on those stations, that the only event of note in the past week was the arrest of a man who may have murdered a little girl ten years ago (but is more likely just a kook, if the forensics mean anything at all).  I don&#8217;t mean to make light of the suffering of a child, but I think most reasonable people would agree that this story wasn&#8217;t even national news back when it was new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catching the headlines on CNN, you wouldn&#8217;t even realize there&#8217;s a war on in Lebanon, that the UN has &#8216;forced&#8217; a ceasefire, and that a crapload of &lt;i&gt;French&lt;/i&gt; troops are being sent in to &lt;s&gt;act as human shields&lt;/s&gt; keep the peace &lt;s&gt;while Hezbollah reloads&lt;/s&gt; while the situation cools down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catching the headlines on CNN, you wouldn&#8217;t even know that the news of this war coming out of Beirut is based at least in part on &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=21956_Reuters_Doctoring_Photos_from_Beirut&amp;only&quot;&gt;doctored photographs&lt;/a&gt;.  Nor would you know that many of the images and videos showing &#8216;victims of the attacks&#8217; are in fact &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=22123_Green_Helmet_Admits_Staging_Photos&amp;only&quot;&gt;staged by Hezbollah sympathizers&lt;/a&gt; who carry corpses around and artfully arrange them to produce the most &#8216;convincing&#8217; imagery possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catching the headlines on CNN, you wouldn&#8217;t even know that the Democratic party has become so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/&quot;&gt;mindless and morally bankrupt&lt;/a&gt; that one of the few liberals who isn&#8217;t actively working to destroy America is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/007765.php&quot;&gt;forced to run as an independent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; know that the NSA wiretapping program has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/18/WIRETAP.TMP&quot;&gt;ruled unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt; (after all, it&#8217;s a defeat for Bush, right?), but you might not have heard that &lt;a href=&quot;http://powerlineblog.com/archives/015041.php&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2006_08_13-2006_08_19.shtml#1155837741&quot;&gt;than&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://irishspy.typepad.com/public_secrets/2006/08/the_dark_legacy.html&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jacklewis.net/weblog/archives/2006/08/judge_that_rule.php&quot;&gt;person&lt;/a&gt; agrees the opinion is full of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve got the Internet thing, &#8216;cause without it who &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; what we&#8217;d know.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the executive summary.  Here&#8217;s the full post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day &lt;a href=&quot;http://joelonsoftware.com/&quot;&gt;The Joel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/10/12.html&quot;&gt;wrote about a book&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Java-Bruce-Tate/dp/0596100949/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt/102-5979582-8351344?ie=UTF8&quot;&gt;Beyond Java&lt;/a&gt;.  Having recently developed an intense interest in finding the next generation of programming languages (live in C# for a few months and you will too) &#8212; and given the fact that Joel&#8217;s summary triggered fond memories of the hilarious, memorable, and absolutely spot-on &lt;a href=&quot;http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html&quot;&gt;Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns&lt;/a&gt; &#8212;  I decided to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a good book.  A bit indecisive &#8212; &lt;i&gt;no one can say, but I think &lt;/i&gt;this&lt;i&gt; or maybe &lt;/i&gt;this&lt;i&gt; but no one can say&lt;/i&gt; &#8212; but interesting reading nonetheless.  And very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; up on Ruby.  Particularly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;, which I had been hearing a lot about from various vectors for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I installed Ruby on Rails, and I followed along with the &#8216;creating a weblog in 15 minutes&#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts&quot;&gt;screencast&lt;/a&gt; and I was (of course) duly impressed.  After dealing with .NET&#8217;s mindless &lt;acronym title=&quot;Structured Query Language&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/acronym&gt; interactivity, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ActiveRecord&quot;&gt;Active Record&lt;/a&gt; alone was enough to knock my socks off, and the scaffolding support atop that was enough to actually knock my socks back on only to knock them off again in some sort of incredible double-knock-sock-knocking knockapalooza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, I&#8217;d never worked with Ruby before so the demo was inscrutable to me; it was impressive, but if you don&#8217;t know Ruby it&#8217;s hard to tell what&#8217;s magic and what&#8217;s, you know, &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt;.  If you&#8217;ve only ever used direct jumps then virtual function dispatch looks pretty damn sexy and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke&apos;s_three_laws&quot;&gt;any sufficiently unfamiliar programming language looks like goddamn sorcery until you figure it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So,&#8221; sez I, &#8220;it must be time to learn Ruby.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-3.html&quot;&gt;With cartoon foxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://whytheluckystiff.net/&quot;&gt;Why guy&lt;/a&gt; is &#8212; if I might be allowed a brief meander into the vernacular &#8212; nucking futz, but he is also endlessly entertaining, far more articulate than most code-friendly persons (Persons of coded descent?  Coding Americans?  Coditos?) ever manage to become, and a pretty talented artist to boot.  And not just &#8216;a talented artist&#8230; for a &lt;i&gt;programmer&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;, actually, like, you know, &lt;i&gt;talented&lt;/i&gt;.  What with the drawing and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the thing that strikes me the hardest about Ruby is the fact class definitions are no longer magic like they are in every other language I&#8217;ve used.  In C++ style languages the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;class foo {&lt;/span&gt; incantation opens a class and the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; closes it and in between you&#8217;ve got a special list of allowed syntax with specific keywords and constructs and laws and regulations and red tape and occasionally tiny little policemen who tell you that a semicolon was expected and that your vehicle registration has expired and would you &lt;i&gt;please remain in the vehicle&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that last part was just in my imagination, it&#8217;s been a while since I did a lot of heavy lifting in C++, but the point is that it&#8217;s a modal language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has none of that.  Writing &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;class Contrived&lt;/span&gt; doesn&#8217;t put your parser into a special mode; if it&#8217;s implemented as I assume it is, it operates more like &#8216;create the class Contrived if it doesn&#8217;t already exist, and then push it&#8217;s context onto the scope stack&#8217;.  And then a few lines later the &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; pops it back off.  And in between &#8212; you can put any damned thing you want.  You can perform I/O.  You can run calculations.  You can &lt;i&gt;call methods that write methods and embed them into your class&lt;/i&gt;.  This shit is &lt;i&gt;hot&lt;/i&gt;.  You know how your C# classes always have like sixty properties that are all coded like&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
private int m_Foo;
public int Foo
{
	get
	{
		return m_Foo;
	}
	set
	{
		m_Foo = value;
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
and you wish you could just drop in a small script that wrote them all for you?  With Ruby, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;.  Except you don&#8217;t &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to, because they wrote one for you already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a language designed to automate that which can be automated.  What&#8217;s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

It&apos;s annoying to me to discover that my server actually has two fewer moving parts than expected, those parts being (i) the fan in the power supply and (ii) the read head on the hard drive.

The first I could probably deal with if I wanted to; the second is thoroughly beyond my powers to combat at this point in my life.

I&apos;ve managed to recover the contents of my blog, &lt;i&gt;sans&lt;/i&gt; comments.  Strange though it sounds, I&apos;ve been writing in this blasted thing since January 2003 (which actually means I&apos;m coming up on 4 years of being an enormous nerd) and I&apos;d like to keep it around.  I suppose it&apos;s like having a child; no matter how glaringly defective your offspring might be, getting rid of them is never really on the table.

The latest development builds of iClan, Stylunk, and Clieunk are all safe and sound, but since my Subversion repository was stored on the dearly departed drive all my history has just been unwritten.  That may or may not be a bad thing -- some of the code in early versions of Stylunk may actually be carcinogenic with prolonged exposure.

What&apos;s a technophile to do?

Well, it turns out my most recent post was long enough ago that it was all in the Google cache, so finding the text of everything was easy enough.  But of course, that&apos;s just the rendered pages... it would be much nicer to somehow transform those into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/mtimport&quot;&gt;Movable Type&apos;s crappt-ass import format&lt;/a&gt;.

This looks like a job for Perl!

Except I hate Perl!

So maybe it&apos;s a job for Ruby!

Long story short, I wrote up a relatively short (56 line) Ruby script that opened all the files I saved from the Google cache, parsed out the post title, body, time and data, and printed it out in a form appropriate for importing into Movable Type.

Doing it in a C language would&apos;ve taken significantly longer; I played with getting the regular expression right by bringing up the interactive Ruby console, I didn&apos;t need to worry about creating a project and setting up compiler targets and what-not... I just wrote code and it did things.  Ruby is probably the most Mac-like language I&apos;ve ever used; things &lt;i&gt;just work&lt;/i&gt;.</text></entry>

&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco&apos;s System&apos;s decision to use the name &apos;iPhone&apos; for their line internet communications was a clear attempt to borrow from the popularity and overwhelmingly positive public perception of Apple&apos;s line of consumer products.  This decision was knowingly and willfully made with the clear intent of confusing consumers and imparting the Apple imprimatur on these uninspired offerings.  As a result, Apple Inc. filed suit today charging Cisco with fraud, copyright infringement, slander, and libel.  Apple CEO Steve Jobs said, &amp;quot;Obviously we regret having to take this drastic step, but Cisco has left us little alternative.  We made a  good-faith effort to settle the issue amicably, including a very generous offer for licensing rights, but Cisco has apparently decided that their stolen slice of Apple&apos;s brand is very nearly priceless.  As it happens, we agree that the value of our branding conventions is incalculable, which is why we&apos;ve been forced to take legal action to reclaim it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<entry id='189' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='1' atom_id='tag:switch.seankerwin.org,2007://1.189' author_id='1' authored_on='20070515134254' basename='i_like_strong_t' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='__default__' created_by='1' created_on='20080324233143' modified_by='1' modified_on='20111221171522' ping_count='0' status='2' title='I like Strong Typing, But This Is Ridiculous' week_number='200720'><text>In C++, I could write a template like the following:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
std::map&amp;lt;string, string&amp;gt; PropertyList;

template&amp;lt;class T&amp;gt;
T GetProperty(const string &amp; propertyName) {
    return T.Parse(PropertyList[propertyName]);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

And it would work so long as it was used properly;  if you tried to fetch a property of a type that lacked a Parse method, you&apos;d fail to compile.  The error message would be a hideous mess, but as long as you the programmer made sure that all your Ts could .Parse, you were golden.

Compare and contrast with C# (2.0):

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Dictionary&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; PropertyList;

T GetProperty&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(String propertyName)
{
    return T.Parse(PropertyList[propertyName]);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

That won&apos;t work, because the .NET compiler wants to be sure that every potential T that this generic method could ever meet has a .Parse method.  &lt;i&gt;Really&lt;/i&gt; sure.  This appears to be because the .NET 2.0 runtime contains intrinsic support for generics, which is actually a really neat feature; in C++ each instantiation of a template becomes its own chunk of code, and the space requirements grow far faster than most programmers expect.  In this sense at least C# generics are far superior, as they propagate the savings in time and effort from the programmer all the way through to the execution environment, while C++ saves the programmer some time but makes the end user pay full freight.

So what&apos;s Microsoft&apos;s solution to the problem?  Pretty much what you&apos;d expect from a company that likes solving every problem with a database: they added a &apos;where&apos; clause.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
T GetProperty&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(String propertyName) where T : IParseable
{
    return T.Parse(PropertyList[propertyName]);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Oh, neat!  That earns me two things: first, the IDE will stop me if I try to invoke this for a type that doesn&apos;t implement the IParseable interface and will do so with a polite error message; second, I can now call any method defined by the IParseable interface within my generic method.

Problem solved, right?  Nope!  Because there &lt;i&gt;isn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; an IParseable.  Ain&apos;t no such beasty.  And if I need to support arbitrary built-in types for my property-fetching system (and it turns out that in the situation that inspired this missive, I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;) I&apos;m pretty-much S-O-L.  Even if I could jump forward in time to get a release copy of the new Orcas build of Visual Studio and upgrade to C# 3.0 with those shiny new extension-methods (which, by the way, Objective-C has had for ages under the name &apos;Categories&apos; -- but that&apos;s another rant) I&apos;d still be screwed.  Extension methods would allow me to put a .Parse method on any and every class I want, but they don&apos;t provide me a mechanism to inject interfaces into existing classes.  The best I could do is inject .Parse into the object base class and then override it appropriately for each case I care about.  Of course that depends on the fact that built-in methods with the same signature as extension methods override the extension, and from what I&apos;ve read that particular behavior&apos;s still a little bit up in the air.

It also leaves me in a situation that&apos;s worse than C++ started from, at least from a maintenance standpoint; I can now attempt to query any object of any type using my GetProperty method, and it&apos;ll compile just fine.  But if it&apos;s a type for which my generic object.Parse injection won&apos;t work, I&apos;ll find out at &lt;i&gt;run time&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;compile time&lt;/i&gt;.  Really the best thing I could do would be to make my default object.Parse method throw a NotImplementedException with a helpful error message, and I think anyone who&apos;s worked on a large project will agree that that kind of solution is a special new kind of &lt;i&gt;suck&lt;/i&gt;.

So what&apos;s the solution?  Well, it&apos;s to cheat:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
T GetProperty&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(String propertyName) where T : IParseable
{
    (T)typeof(T).GetMethod(&quot;Parse&quot;, new Type[] { typeof(string) }).Invoke(null, new object[] { PropertyList[propertyName] });
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

I feel dirty writing that, but at least it compiles and works -- as long as you remember not to pass in something without a Parse method, because that&apos;s a one-way-trip to UnhandledExceptionville.</text></entry>

Some months back I ended up writing some rather complicated C# code; it had to dynamically assemble the appropriate JavaScript code to handle the client-side navigation in the new interface to an older product.  I&apos;m not going into any specifics because frankly I don&apos;t remember them, but there came a point in my coding when I began to feel a profound sense of d&amp;eacute;ja vu -- after a moment of introspection I realized the code I was writing differed from a block I hard written the previous day in all but the innermost three lines of an enormously complicated multi-method deeply-nested looping mess.  My memory&apos;s hazy, but I think there was recursion involved, and there may have been snakes.

Anyway, I did what any lazy C# coder would do; I abstracted the outer logic into a single method that took a C# delegate as a parameter, and called it with two different delegates to handle the two different inner sections of this monstrosity.  For the uninitiated, by the way, a C# delegate is an enormously complex and advanced computer science construct that most of the smarter folks in the field call a &apos;function&apos;.  Why they felt it was more efficient to add this new thing instead of just adding first-class functions -- and believe me that their approach is the hard way, because delegates by their design basically require you to think about things like closures and continuations very carefully -- continues to elude me, but if the only screwdriver available is a left-handed electric drill powered by a gerbil in a wheel I know where I&apos;m going if I&apos;ve got a screw.  The main point of this paragraph is that I was conscious of the ugliness of my solution as I was writing it; it was just structurally inelegant.  The fact that the C# 2.0 anonymous delegate support (mmm, syntactical sugar) negated the need to define independent functions didn&apos;t really help; it was ugly.  It would&apos;ve been much better to simply pass some code into the function directly, somehow.

Today I had to revise a caching system; items can be fetched based on one of two criteria, and storing two copies in the cache was ugly.  My solution was to cache them under a single identifier and maintain a map from the first type of identifier to the second.  It&apos;s not a terribly complex thing, but the vagaries of the .NET caching system and some additional constraints imposed by the app made it relatively difficult to get exactly right.  When I realized that I needed to apply this same methodology to several different kinds of things, I sighed deeply and got to work writing several delegate definitions and adding &amp;lt;generic&amp;gt; tags all over.  In the end I had a system that could be used for any class fetchable by these two criteria (I didn&apos;t feel up to building it generic enough to multicache based on any two criteria).  Two delegates, two wrapper methods, etc.  Would&apos;ve been much easier to just pass a block of code in, but you do what you can with what you have where you are, &lt;i&gt;n&apos;est-ce pas&lt;/i&gt;?

It turns out that Microsoft has been having the same sort of problem, actually.  Far too many people have written off the new features in C# 3.0 as mere syntactical sugar to make LINQ easy, but there&apos;s at least one item of massive importance that a lot of people seem to have missed.  The new lambda expression in C# 3.0 are more than just a still-terser form of anonymous delegates, because in some situations -- and I&apos;m still not clear as to the &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; or the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;, nor about whether non-Microsoft coders can easily join in the fun -- they aren&apos;t sent as delegates, but as parsed expression trees.  Trees which the receiving code may then, if it wishes, alter, compose, or mangle in whatever way it sees fit.

That&apos;s how LINQ-to-DB works; the syntactical sugar decodes into a bunch of lambda functions which are passed as &lt;i&gt;expressions&lt;/i&gt; to the appropriate LINQ-provided method, which can then interpret, parse, and combine them so as to produce a reasonable query (as opposed to the query-all-join-in-code that would be necessary without this change).  Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, .NET supports passing code to a method.

It remains to be seen whether anything useful can actually come of this, of course.  If it&apos;s only used for LINQ and nothing else then it&apos;s just another example of Microsoft embracing and extending, though I guess it&apos;s a bit less nefarious when they do it to their own product.  But if library-builders can wrap their brains around this -- and if the implementation is robust enough to be useful for anything beyond the narrow case for which it was invented -- this is pretty cool stuff.

Here&apos;s hoping .NET 4.0 lets an assembly access itself as an expression tree, eh?</text></entry>

Now I&apos;m working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations&quot;&gt;XSLT&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  I want the transformations to be fast, of course, which means I need to learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; (because, though you&apos;d never really know at first blush, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-xslt/&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations&quot;&gt;XSLT&lt;/abbr&gt; is a full-on language&lt;/a&gt;).

So in hindsight, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html&quot;&gt;Extract method&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/inlineMethod.html&gt;inline method&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceTempWithQuery.html&gt;replace temp with query&lt;/a&gt;... this is all about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency&quot;&gt;referential transparency&lt;/a&gt;, isn&apos;t it?  The concepts are really inextricably linked, very obviously for those refactorings and less obviously but no less intrinsically to many other refactorings.

But referential transparency is all about about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function&quot;&gt;pure-functional&lt;/a&gt; programming, removing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29&quot;&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;.  And side effects are like globals (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern&quot;&gt;singletons&lt;/a&gt;, and Lord do I &lt;a href=&quot;http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/singleton-considered-stupid&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; singletons&lt;/a&gt;) but isn&apos;t an object method kind of a like a function with the object properties as globals?  How&apos;s it different?  Is it?

If maintainable code is refactorable, and refactorable code is functional, and objects are inherently tied up with side-effects, and side-effects are non-trivially incompatible with functional programming, how the hell are we not all globally and intrinsically screwed?</text></entry>

Visual Studio is actually a relatively nice IDE, at least in terms of the hooks it provides for customization.  I&apos;ve remapped most key commands to work the way I&apos;m used to using them on a Mac, and until today I had Parallels set to swap my command and control keys, meaning that for the most part Windows felt almost like another Mac app -- a hideously ugly Mac app with its own file system and two menu bars which was pointlessly confined to one screen, but a Mac app nonetheless.  Sort of.

The biggest problem with this solution was that the swapped control and command keys seemed to lag; if I released the command key and started typing too quickly, Windows would register the first few characters as being typed with the control key down, often to hilarious effect.  For some reason, when Parallels swaps keys it introduces keyboard latency -- &lt;i&gt;for those keys only&lt;/i&gt;.  That last part is the real problem; if the whole keyboard lagged I&apos;d probably be fine (I&apos;m pretty well accustomed to out-typing programs, I&apos;ve been doing it for quite some time).  It&apos;s a pretty glaring bug, and it renders the Parallel&apos;s key-swapping feature well-nigh useless.

But, as luck would have it, Windows has built-in keyboard remapping hooks.  I say &apos;hooks&apos; instead of &apos;features&apos; because I refuse to consider anything that makes me thing about endianness a &apos;feature&apos;... But I digress.  Open up RegEdit and browse to &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; Keyboard Layout&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;, right below it) and add a new binary value.

Then make it look like this:

&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/scancode.gif&quot; alt=&quot;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 1D 00 5B E0 00 00 00 00&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;(00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 1D 00 5B E0 00 00 00 00)&lt;/span&gt;

That will turn your left windows key into a left control key.  Restart Windows, turn off Parallel&apos;s key remapping, and you&apos;re good to go.</text></entry>

To some extent that promised Objective-C 2.0 improvements should help, but there are a lot of things available now that I&apos;d wager 99% of the Cocoa-coding public don&apos;t know about.

For instance, the Xclan players window lets you see a simple list of players, or a list grouped by clan or profession (visually it looks like the new style source list found in the latest iLife apps).  The data for this is simply an &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;NSArray&lt;/code&gt; containing &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;NSDictionary&lt;/code&gt; objects specifying the info for players.  So given that data structure, how do you list the clans of all the online players?

&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
[playersArray valueForKey:@&quot;Clan&quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

That&apos;s pretty basic.  Calling &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;valueForKey&lt;/code&gt; is similar to calling &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;map( )&lt;/code&gt; in other languages; it returns the array of the results of calling &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;valueForKey&lt;/code&gt; on each member individually.  It&apos;s not defined in NSArray.h, but in NSKeyValueCoding.h as a category, and as a result you&apos;ll never find it if you&apos;re not looking &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; hard.  Kinda makes me wish Xcode had code completion that&apos;s not a total joke.

Of course, that&apos;s not very useful code in itself, because it won&apos;t eliminate duplicates.  If there are two folks from the same clan online and you&apos;re trying to draw them grouped by clan, an array that has that clan in it twice isn&apos;t very useful.  Which is why you want to do this:

&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[[NSSet setWithArray:&lt;/b&gt;[playersArray valueForKey:@&quot;Clan&quot;]&lt;b&gt;] allObjects]&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;NSSet&lt;/code&gt; is probably the neatest Cocoa class that never gets used.  Or maybe it just seems that way to me because I&apos;ve spent the last week optimizing a set implementation in C# (and if anyone thinks a week seems long for that, well, try doing a multithreaded set intersection and ring me back when you&apos;ve got it working flawlessly).  I&apos;m not sure how Apple&apos;s is implemented (I can haz &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap&quot;&gt;treap&lt;/a&gt;?) but in this particular case all I need it to do is enforce uniqueness, so I&apos;m cool.

The order of the objects returned by &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;NSSet&lt;/code&gt;&apos;s &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;allObjects&lt;/code&gt; method doesn&apos;t seem to be guaranteed to be anything useful, so just to be safe we should follow that last snippet up with a sort:

&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[&lt;/b&gt;[[NSSet setWithArray:[playersArray valueForKey:@&quot;Clan&quot;]] allObjects] &lt;b&gt;sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(compare:)]&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

But, final wrinkle, &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;playersArray&lt;/code&gt; contains an entry for every character we&apos;ve ever seen (so we can cache their information and save notes), and online/offline status is determined by an entry in that character&apos;s dictionary.  Ideally our list of clans should only reflect clans that have at least one member online -- how can we do that?

&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;playersArray = [playersArray filteredArrayUsingPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@&quot;SELF.Online == &apos;YES&apos;&quot;]];&lt;/b&gt;
[[[NSSet setWithArray:[playersArray valueForKey:@&quot;Clan&quot;]] allObjects] sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(compare:)];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;NSPredicate&lt;/code&gt; was added with CoreData and not particularly well-documented outside of that context, but it adds a category method to &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;NSArray&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;filteredArrayUsingPredicate&lt;/code&gt; that adds a degree of expressiveness to arrays that Cocoa hasn&apos;t had before.  The format string for an NSPredicate uses a minimal language based around key-value coding, so it can introspect arbitrarily into KVC-compatible objects stored in the array -- think of it like doing a SQL-style query against your in-memory data structures.

---

Anyhoo, that&apos;s some neat stuff you can do with Cocoa that (a) lots of people don&apos;t know about (b) isn&apos;t particularly well-documented.</text></entry>

Typically this comes up because I want the ability to chain method invocations; it&apos;s much easier to type Marklar.CreateNew( ... ).Save( ).SendTo( ... ) than it is to break that out over three or more lines and introduce a local variable (at least to me).  It also shows up when you&apos;re doing any heavily generic programming, when you want a clone( ) method, and a host of other unusual-but-not-unheard of cases.

The obvious (and unsatisfying) way to do this is as follows:
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt; 
class BaseMarklar {
	public BaseMarklar Self( ) { return this; }
}

class BlueMarklar : BaseMarklar {
	public void Frob( ) { ... }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The problem there is that if I have a reference to a BlueMarklar and invoke Self, the result of the call isn&apos;t a BlueMarklar, but a BaseMarklar.  If I want to do something BlueMarklar-specific to the result (like Frob( ) it) I&apos;ll need to cast down the inheritance hierarchy, which as we all know is akin to crossing the streams except with fewer toasted marshmallows and more unforeseen crashing bugs.

There are a lot of things you can try to get around this, but none of them work quite right.  Virtual functions don&apos;t work, because an override with a different method signature isn&apos;t an override.  Leaving it out of the base class and instituting an external rule that subclasses must implement Self( ) doesn&apos;t work, because then you can&apos;t call it polymorphically and besides nobody&apos;s going to implement it anyway.

Eventually you&apos;ll try getting clever; If you&apos;re in C#, for instance, you&apos;ll wonder: what if Self were a generic method?
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
class BaseMarklar {
	public T Self&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;( ) { return (T) this; }
}

class BlueMarklar : BaseMarklar {
	public void Frob( ) { ... }
}

class RedMarklar : BaseMarklar {
	public void Frizzle( ) { ... }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
You&apos;ll realize pretty quickly that this won&apos;t compile because the cast from this to T is invalid, but in keeping with the long-standing Microsoft tradition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/archives/2007/05/i_like_strong_t.shtml&quot;&gt;solving every problem with a where clause&lt;/a&gt;, this is not an insoluble problem:
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
class BaseMarklar {
	public T Self&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;( ) where T:BaseMarklar { return (T) this; }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
That kinda-sorta works; You&apos;ll need to manually specify the generic type for Self( ) every time you invoke it (because there are no parameters from which to infer), but if you can live with the admittedly minor annoyance of typing MyBlueMarklar.Self&amp;lt;BlueMarklar&amp;gt;( ).Frob( ) then you might say it&apos;s good enough.

Until someone else has to work with or support your code, of course.  Because you&apos;ve given them a loaded gun, which they&apos;re free to point and fire just by typing MyBlueMarklar.Self&amp;lt;RedMarklar&amp;gt;( ).Frizzle( ).  Whoops!  Because the calling code provides the return type of Self( ), it&apos;s free to do dumb things like cast to a sibling type.

So how do you prevent this?  Well, here&apos;s  &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; solution:
&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
class BaseMarklar&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; where T:BaseMarklar&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {
	public T Self() { return (T)this; }
}

class BlueMarklar : BaseMarklar&amp;lt;BlueMarklar&amp;gt; {
	public void Frob() { ... }
}

class RedMarklar : BaseMarklar&amp;lt;RedMarklar&amp;gt; {
	public void Frizzle() { ... }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Weird, ain&apos;t it?  The more I think about this, the more I&apos;m amazed that it works (and it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; work... or at least it passes all my unit tests).  We&apos;re building classes that inherit from a generic class that&apos;s parameterized on the class we&apos;re creating.

I haven&apos;t had time to test it out, but I&apos;m 99% sure this would be impossible with C++ templates -- because templates are essentially expanded like glorified macros during compilation and base classes have to be successfully compiled before compiling subclasses, you&apos;d end up with a circular dependency problem.  I can imagine this causing stack overflows on a whole class of code-analysis tools.</text></entry>

I know this because I have a thought that English won&apos;t allow me to express directly, a concept that clearly needs a handle so we can package it up and pass it around and maybe stick it in a book or paint it on the wall.  But because the concept doesn&apos;t have a name I can&apos;t explain it except by pointing out lots of things that are *like* it but aren&apos;t quite it.

The original Star Trek series had an episode entitled [*The Squire of Gothos*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squire_of_Gothos); it featured an alien who considered himself an expert on Earth based on having observed it from a distance.  His understanding of what he saw, however, was fatally flawed by the method of observation; in seeking to recreate he things he had seen, he created [&quot;fire without heat and food and drink without flavor&quot;](http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/The_Squire_of_Gothos).  His distant and alien perspective prevented him from understanding that the point of fire was heat, and that the point of fine food is taste.

After US forces withdrew from Micronesia after WWII, the natives set up mock airfields, dressed themselves as soldiers, and attempt to cause supply planes to land.  These [cargo cults](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) managed to create impressive facsimiles of landing strips but never managed to land a plane; their technologically primitive perspective stopped them from recognizing that the planes caused the landing strips rather than the converse.

Other people have noticed this missing word and latched on to the cargo cult metaphor to explain it.  [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) coined the term [&apos;Cargo Cult Science&apos;](http://wwwcdf.pd.infn.it/~loreti/science.html) in his 1974 Caltech commencement address.  The term &apos;Cargo Cult Programming&apos; has also come up -- I *think* the term originated with [Eric Lippert](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/about.aspx) in [one of his many excellent blog posts](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/01/syntax-semantics-micronesian-cults-and-novice-programmers.aspx).  In any case the underlying meaning is the same -- understanding the form of something while completely mistaking the function.

After the success of the iMac, Dell came out with a host of low-end PCs in partially-translucent cases.  Same pattern -- the success of the iMac isn&apos;t a result of the translucent plastic, that&apos;s just one particular form of a more meaningful underlying concept.  Subsequent iMacs don&apos;t look anything like the original and are made of radically different materials, but they still have the same underlying nature.

The [LG Voyager](http://products.vzw.com/index.aspx?id=rlp&amp;site=next&amp;phone=voyager) is being touted as Verizon&apos;s answer to the iPhone, but it&apos;s the same story again. The essence of the iPhone isn&apos;t in any particular input technology or user interface convention; sure those things are revolutionary on their own, but the they&apos;re just incidental.  They are expressions of the core nature of the item, not the definition of that nature.

What brings this up?  Actually, it&apos;s politics.  Reading Democratic positions on national security  always makes me wish this word existed, because they all understand at a formal level that they need to support national security to be elected while simultaneously failing to understand what national security really means.  It&apos;s not a strictly partisan failing, of course -- Republicans on gay marriage manage the same intellectual failure quite frequently -- but that&apos;s just what brought it to mind.

I wish someone would discover this word -- it would make communicating these ideas a hell of a lot easier -- but at the same time I&apos;m itching to hear a Republican candidate blast his opponent for &apos;cargo cult security&apos;.</text></entry>

It all started with a method signature for accessing a range of a collection; I had specced the interface to be in the form:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
int GetMarklarCount( );
IEnumerable&amp;lt;Marklar&amp;gt; GetMarklars( int skip, int count );
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
I intended this to mean &apos;skip this number of items, and then give me the next this many&apos; -- the first page would be ( 0, 10 ) and the second would be ( 10, 10 ), for instance (assuming ten items per page).  I had referred to this idiom as &apos;pagination support&apos;, because the key goal of the design was to allow clients of the service to support pagination in the UI.

Other folks had duplicated the idiom but misinterpreted it, assuming that the &lt;code&gt;skip&lt;/code&gt; parameter represented the number of &lt;i&gt;pages&lt;/i&gt; to skip, and the count parameter specified the size of a page, so fetching those same two pages would be ( 0, 10 ) and ( 1, 10 ).

We had a discussion and my meaning won out, but it quickly segued into a discussion of the relative merits of &lt;code&gt;GetMarklars( int skip, int count )&lt;/code&gt; and the similar &lt;code&gt;GetMarklars( int first, int count )&lt;/code&gt;.  I favored the signature using &apos;skip&apos; as I feel it&apos;s less ambiguous: saying &apos;first&apos; brings up the obvious question of whether the first element is element zero or element one, and I&apos;d prefer not to have that degree of uncertainty in an interface.

All of which merely serves to get to my main point: the fact that programming today uses zero-based indexing is a &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; weird anachronism.

In assembly language zero-based indexing makes perfect sense, because the index is actually an offset from the base address.  C, being intended as a slightly-higher-level portable assembly language, maintained this convention as a way of keeping old-school assembly hackers happy (and to support the perpetual question of whether indexing an array is faster or slower than pointer arithmetic, of course).  That (to my mind) was still reasonable, because you simply can&apos;t be an effective C programmer without understanding memory management at a low enough level that this makes perfect sense.

The strange part is that in today&apos;s far-higher-level languages there&apos;s no need to index from zero, and in fact indexing from zero is a point of confusion for new programmers.  A new programmer learning Python may never understand the hardware at a low enough level to recognize that an array index is an offset from an address (and in my experience lots of people who &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have the hardware background to understand this never manage to make the connection).

So why do we still index from zero?  Why, because we&apos;re used to it!  A new language with collections indexed from one would be instantly regarded as a toy by most established coders -- look at how &apos;pro&apos; coders regard VisualBasic (not that there aren&apos;t plenty of other, more valid, things to criticize about VB).  So new languages index from zero to keep the established coders happy, or they fail to index from zero and the established coders never look at them and they die off.  New programmers are eventually conditioned to think that indexing from zero is just the natural way to do things, and sooner or later the cycle repeats.

But you have to wonder: how many people out there would be entirely capable of getting good work done in Python or Ruby or whatever were it not for this single little nit?  I know there are decent programmers out there who always allocate one array space more than they need and simply ignore index zero, and it&apos;s not totally clear to me that these people are any worse at their job if you ignore their indexing eccentricity.

I&apos;m forced to wonder: are today&apos;s programmers unwittingly allowing their anachronistic indexing preference to render the field less accessible to newcomers?  Are we selling out the next generation?

How do you solve this problem?  Obviously just launching a language with one-based indexing will fix exactly nothing, because nobody&apos;s going to use such a language.  The only real solution I can see is to launch a language with no indexing.  The &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; constructs that are showing up in more and more languages are a good first step, but they have a few problems, mainly that they&apos;re an all-or-nothing affair.  It&apos;s hard to imagine a &lt;code&gt;foresome&lt;/code&gt; construct that works as intuitively.

Iterators are another solution, but they&apos;re still not perfect.  First, an iterator is a very abstract object, as objects go.  &apos;The current state of the process of iterating over the contents of a collection&apos; isn&apos;t something most people can think of as a &apos;thing&apos;, and for better or for worse people prefer to model objects as nouns (at least in &lt;a href=&quot;http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html&quot;&gt;most kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;).  Iterators are a complex and abstract concept and many programmers find them baffling.  And even after you&apos;ve got the concept down, iterators can still make for some really hairy code:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for_each( c.begin( ), find_if( c.begin( ), c.end( ) SomePredicate( ) ), SomeFunctor( ) )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Doesn&apos;t exactly roll off the tongue, does it?

So what&apos;s the answer?  Probably to do what we (where by &apos;we&apos; I mean &apos;people who are smarter than me&apos;) are already doing -- leave our arrays zero-indexed to keep compatibility with the installed base of programmer-brains, and keep searching for cleaner syntax to describe declarative array iteration.  In the mean time, train new programmers to think in terms of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; instead of in terms of looping, which probably means functional programming at an early age, and try to move that way ourselves.</text></entry>

Unfortunately, the old way of doing things had one big benefit: I could command-double-click on &lt;code&gt;NSStringCompareOptions&lt;/code&gt; to jump straight to the declaration of that symbol in NSString.h, which is really the only way I could ever remember that &lt;code&gt;NSAnchoredSearch&lt;/code&gt; is the setting I need to make this particular line work properly.

Everyone knows that Google works with massive clusters of low-end hardware, and that their algorithms are uniquely designed for this architecture.  That&apos;s the big clue, and I can figure out how (at a conceptual level) every aspect of a search can be parallelized except for the final and crucial result-ordering step.  It&apos;s been bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today in the course of doing something entirely unrelated I stumbled over a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_sorting&quot;&gt;layman-level summary of the MapReduce algorithm&lt;/a&gt; that somehow made the whole thing click in my head.  What&apos;s funny there is that I&apos;ve read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html&quot;&gt;MapReduce&lt;/a&gt; plenty in the past; I just never made the connection until reading &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/span&gt;&apos;s decidedly nontechnical summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, long story short, I think I have a general idea how Google works now.  I&apos;m never really sure I understand something until I can explain it though, so in a fit of irony I&apos;m going to explain my guesses about Google on a page that will probably only be read by Google&apos;s indexing bot.  So hurray for antiphrasis[1]!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, some context is in order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling what you do with Google a &apos;search&apos; is somewhat misleading; it evokes the image of Google&apos;s servers actively navigating the internet looking for you content.  With a little thought it becomes obvious that that&apos;s not how it works; not only would individual Google searches take hours, but the traffic generated by even a small subset of Google&apos;s normal users would grind the entire internet to a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone far more clever than I once pointed out that &quot;almost all programming can be viewed as an exercise in caching&quot;[2], and modern search has taken that maxim to heart.  Just about every search engine -- from Google all the way down to Spotlight -- works by generating an index of the content and conducting actual queries by examining the index.  Think of the index as a great big map (or hash or dictionary, whatever term you prefer) between tokens and sets of documents.  If you look in the index under &apos;marklar&apos; you&apos;ll get back a set of every document containing that &apos;word&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that I&apos;m using the word &apos;set&apos; instead of &apos;list&apos;.  There are two reasons for that -- first, it is indeed a set rather than a list, in the strict mathematical sense that each item (a document in this case, or more accurately a URL, ID, GUID, or other form of document identifier) appears in the collection exactly zero or one times (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/quotes&quot;&gt;five is right out!&lt;/a&gt;).  The second reason I&apos;m being careful to say &apos;set&apos; has to do with complex queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you search for &apos;marklar&apos; you look in the index for the set of documents containing that term, you order them (more on that later!) and you show them to the user.  Bada-bing, bada-boom, Bob&apos;s your uncle, and so on and so forth.  But what if you want to search for &apos;smurfing marklar&apos;?  Ideally that would show you every document that contains both &apos;smurfing&apos; and &apos;marklar&apos;, right?  Well, if our index can give us the result sets for each individual term, then we can find the desired combined result set by taking the intersection of those two sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the intersection of two lists is a pain in the butt -- O(n*m) in general, O(n+m) if you can guarantee both are sorted, but either way not the sort of thing that scales well to searching large numbers of documents (such as, for instance, the entire freaking internet).  But if you store your sets in something clever called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap&quot;&gt;treap&lt;/a&gt; (which is, exactly as it sounds, the bastard child of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure&quot;&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29&quot;&gt;heap&lt;/a&gt;) you can get it to work in O(m log n/m), and you can even parallelize things to work in O(log m/n) if you happen to have m cores lying around, which is, in a word, fast as hell.  So: Sets?  Important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you look at search as an exercise in set combination, you start to see that the search term is itself a statement in a very loose and forgiving programming language: &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;smurfing marklar &lt;/span&gt;OR&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; foo &lt;/span&gt;NOT&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; bar&lt;/span&gt;&quot; can be parsed into a syntax tree which can then be expressed as a series of set operations: ( (&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;smurfing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;marklar&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; ) &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;, for instance.  If you know the performance characteristics well enough to devise appropriate heuristics, you can even write an optimizer to tweak the abstract syntax tree for your query into a more performant form.  Yet another victory for the thesis that everything in computer science is a compiler, I guess.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point: &lt;a href=&quot;http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html&quot;&gt;Yegge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a problem there, though: how do you distribute it?  Merging sets can actually be parallelized pretty nicely on a single machine (like I said, m cores get you O(log m/n) time), but there&apos;s no good way to find the intersection of a set on machine A and a set on machine B; the communication overhead would dwarf any gain you got by distributing the problem.  So you really need to have the full index available on the same machine to run a query, which might not work so well when you&apos;re indexing, say, the freaking entire internet.  It also means your scaling solution is going to be &apos;adding more and more powerful machines&apos; instead of &apos;adding &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;wimpy&lt;/i&gt; machines&apos;, so even if that approach were viable it&apos;s not explaining Google.  I&apos;ll come back to this in a few paragraphs.  Wait for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, now you&apos;ve got a set: a great big pile of documents that match your query.  That&apos;s actually the &apos;easy&apos; part -- Yahoo was doing that long before Google showed up and ate their lunch, and they&apos;ll probably just keep on doing it until the end of time if Microsoft doesn&apos;t buy them and turn them into Facebook 2 (subtitle: &apos;The Facebookening&apos;) first.  The really tricky part, and the part that Google got so right, is putting that pile of search results into a meaningful order.  There are traditional ways of calculating the relevance of a search result, and most of them involve looking at the incidence of a term within a document and trying to calculate how &apos;important&apos; the word is to that semantic meaning of the document, and then making the assumption that if &apos;marklar&apos; is heavily important to document A (40% of the tokens in the document are marklar or related terms) and minimally important to document B (the word &apos;marklar&apos; only shows up once) then A is a more relevant result than B (there&apos;s more to it, but that&apos;s the conceptual gist, at least as I choose to understand it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two big problems with that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem one is that it just doesn&apos;t work very well; it&apos;s easy to game the heuristic by just repeating the target keyword over and over again through the page, a manipulation that spawned the field of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization&quot;&gt;search engine &apos;optimization&apos;&lt;/a&gt; and lead to a cartload of annoying crap on the internet.  You can make your heuristic smarter, but ultimately you&apos;re in an arms race against a whole host of people with strong economic incentive to break your system, and you&apos;re not going to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second big problem with the sets-then-sorts approach is performance.  To do this effectively you need to complete the entire set operation phase prior to sorting and displaying results, and you need to sort the entire result set before you can reliably return the first page of results to the user.  That&apos;s clearly suboptimal; ideally you&apos;d like to front-load the effort and get the first page of results out there ASAP, and then finish page 2 at your leisure while the user looks through page 1.  That&apos;s the part that&apos;s always given me a headache, because I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; (or at least, &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; I know) that Google doesn&apos;t compute the whole result set before I see page one; if that were case you&apos;d see a vast performance disparity between loading page 1 and page 2 of the results; the first page would take longer, and subsequent pages would be almost instant, which I certainly haven&apos;t ever noticed.  It would also be the case that Google knew on page 1 exactly how many pages of results there would be, which often isn&apos;t the case (more on &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; later, too!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I think Google does it?  They cheat!  Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think Google actually uses MapReduce for searching (it&apos;s used for indexing, but not searching), but the design of MapReduce is the key; it&apos;s a two-stage algorithm.  As the first step each distributed node produces an intermediate result set, &lt;i&gt;in the form of a map&lt;/i&gt;.  That&apos;s the important bit -- the first phase produces not a set, not a list, but a map.  So back to searching: What if each page had an absolute relevance score that has nothing to do with the search, but is in fact and intrinsic property of the page -- some sort of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank&quot;&gt;Page Rank&lt;/a&gt;, let&apos;s say.  That way instead of generating a result set as one big set, you could create a bunch of different sets: the rank 1 set, the rank 0.9 set, and so on.  Just break things down by rank ranges and throw results into buckets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that get you?  Distribute your index to multiple machines, such that every document is on exactly one node (in reality there&apos;d be redundant, backup and failover nodes, but that&apos;s not relevant to the core algorithm).  Further, have each node maintain multiple indices, one for all the rank 1 pages, one for all the rank 0.9 pages, et cetera (this could also be done by having multiple indices to the same data, but I don&apos;t think it makes a conceptual difference).  Then sprinkle in a handful of master/controller nodes to manage all these index nodes.  When a master node gets a search request, broadcast the search down to every slave and let them get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Program slaves to front-load the high-ranking working, and have them signal the controller as each bucket is filled.  When a controller has heard a completion signal for rank 1 pages from every slave node, have it pull back just those rank 1 nodes, order them based on old-fashioned relevance ranking, and feed them back to the user.  Meanwhile the slave nodes can keep chugging away on the rank 0.9 - 0.1 indices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would mean a couple of things: firstly, you wouldn&apos;t know exactly how many total results you had when your first page of results were ready; you could approximate it by checking the number of matches vs. documents checked on each node (node A has found 12 matches after scanning 10,000 pages, so since node A contains a total of 100,000 results we probably have about 120 matches on node A).  If that guess is off your pager will be incorrect; a user might click page seven only to find himself on page five, with no indication six or seven exist, or a user might click the last link in the pager to find there are suddenly many more pages.  Secondly, this model would mean that relevance is a second-order consideration when ranking results; a highly-ranked page that mentions &apos;marklar&apos; in passing might outrank a minimally-linked post on a free hosting site that happens to be entirely about marklars.  Both of those predicted outcomes match behavior I&apos;ve seen from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is this how Google works?  Probably not.  And even if I got some of the stuff right at a high level, there are doubtless innumerable details I&apos;ve missed out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was fun to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Antiphrasis is a word that means irony; of course my usage here is not according to the standard definition of irony (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tv.com/futurama/the-devils-hands-are-idle-playthings/episode/165490/trivia.html&quot;&gt;as Bender explained&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;The use of words expressing something/Other than their literal intention&quot;) but according to the far-more-common yet far-less-correct &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Usage_controversy&quot;&gt;Alanis Morissette meaning&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;It&apos;s like rain/On your wedding day&quot;).  Ironically enough (Alanis), that means that my incorrect usage of the word antiphrasis here is in fact ironic (Bender).  So by using it incorrectly, I&apos;m using it correctly. &amp;nbsp;Noodle on that one for a while,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Gödel&quot;&gt;Gödel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] Terje Mathisen.

&lt;div&gt;If you look at that script, you&apos;ll probably notice a few things (besides the fact that we&apos;re training our human computer to be unbearably rude). &amp;nbsp;What if the answer to step one is &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;? &amp;nbsp;Different people (computers) might handle that differently. &amp;nbsp;Some might hang up; some might continue on to step two; some might ask question one over and over until the frustrated customer picks &apos;yes&apos; or &apos;no&apos; (we&apos;d call that &quot;undefined behavior&quot;, which basically means we don&apos;t know in advance what&apos;s going to happen; undefined behavior is a source of some pretty nasty bugs). What if there&apos;s something wrong with the product besides an inability to turn it on or off? &amp;nbsp;What if the product won&apos;t turn on because it&apos;s broken?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Those are all bugs in our program, and they all serve to show part of what makes programming difficult; decomposing a task (&apos;make customers happy&apos;) into tiny little steps that a mindless automaton can follow is very difficult. &amp;nbsp;You can&apos;t count on a computer to make a value judgement; you can&apos;t count on a computer to recognize that &apos;yeah&apos; or &apos;yup&apos; also mean &apos;yes&apos;; you can&apos;t count on a computer to do much of anything except for faithfully following whatever flawed or incomplete script you give it. &amp;nbsp;That and math.&lt;/div&gt; </text></entry>

 &lt;p&gt;I fell down a chain of links today and wound up reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html&quot;&gt;one of Paul Graham&apos;s numerous pro-Lisp essays&lt;/a&gt;.  I responded as I typically do by attempting to implement his examples in whatever language I have handy, which today was C# 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example Graham cites in the appendix is a function for generating accumulators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(defun foo (n)
  (lambda (i) (incf n i)))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of me who always find reading Lisp akin to reading the opening chapters of the Bible (but with parentheses standing in for the voluminous &apos;begats&apos;), he also helpfully provides equivalents in a few other languages, such as JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;function foo(n) { 
  return function (i) { 
		   return n += i } }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An accumulator is a function that maintains internal state; when you invoke it with a new value it adds that value to its internal state and returns the new sum.  An example usage would be to initialize it to zero and invoke it with each value in an array of integers; the result of the final invocation would be the sum of the integers -- or rather, the accumulation of the values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;var myAcc = foo(0); // Initialize to zero
myAcc(1); // 0 + 1 = 1
myAcc(10); // 0 + 1 + 10 = 11
myAcc(44); // 0 + 1 + 10 + 44 = 55
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, can we build that in C#?  The answer is an enthusiastic &apos;kinda&apos;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[TestFixture]
public class AccumulatorTest
{
	private delegate int Accumulator(int inc);

	private static Accumulator MakeAccumulator(int start)
	{
		int n = start;

		return delegate(int inc)
		{
			n = n + inc;
			return n;
		};
	}

	[Test]
	public void TestAccumulator()
	{
		Accumulator acc = MakeAccumulator(0);

		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0, acc(0));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1, acc(1));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1 + 10, acc(10));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 44, acc(44));
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not actually that long -- the &lt;code&gt;TestAccumulator&lt;/code&gt; function at the bottom is a quickie NUnit test case to verify it&apos;s doing what I think it should.  It&apos;s still longer than the Lisp or JavaScript version though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&apos;s one other major difference from those versions -- typing.  The C# version only works on integers, whereas the Lisp and JavaScript version will work on anything that can be added.  But if we try to genericize the C# code we&apos;ll run into problems at the &lt;code&gt;n = n + inc&lt;/code&gt; statement, because you can&apos;t add two objects and thus can&apos;t add two generic objects without a generic constraint guaranteeing you can.  And since there&apos;s no &lt;code&gt;IAddable&lt;/code&gt; interface that integers and floats and strings and everything implement (and since C# still doesn&apos;t have a more generalized form of &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause that would let us specify constraints as duck types rather than static types), we&apos;re basically SOL with a generic C# accumulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or are we?&lt;/i&gt; (Bum-bum-&lt;b&gt;BUM&lt;/b&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we passed our &lt;code&gt;MakeAccumulator&lt;/code&gt; function two parameters: a starting value, and a delegate function to use for incrementing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[TestFixture]
public class AccumulatorTest
{
	private delegate T Accumulator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T inc);

	private delegate T AccumulationDelegate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T a, T b);

	private static Accumulator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; MakeAccumulator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T start, AccumulationDelegate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; accumulationDelegate)
	{
		T n = start;

		return delegate(T inc)
		{
			n = accumulationDelegate(n, inc);
			return n;
		};
	}

	[Test]
	public void TestIntAccumulator()
	{
		Accumulator&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; acc = MakeAccumulator(0, delegate(int a, int b) { return a + b; });

		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0, acc(0));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1, acc(1));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1 + 10, acc(10));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 44, acc(44));
	}

	[Test]
	public void TestFloatAccumulator()
	{
		Accumulator&amp;lt;float&amp;gt; acc = MakeAccumulator((float)0, delegate(float a, float b) { return a + b; });

		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0, acc(0));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1, acc(1));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1 + 10, acc(10));
		Assert.AreEqual(0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 44, acc(44));
	}

	[Test]
	public void TestStringAccumulator()
	{
		Accumulator&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; acc = MakeAccumulator(&quot;&quot;, delegate(string a, string b) { return a + b; });

		Assert.AreEqual(&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, acc(&quot;&quot;));
		Assert.AreEqual(&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;marklar&quot;, acc(&quot;marklar&quot;));
		Assert.AreEqual(&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;marklar&quot; + &quot;smurf&quot;, acc(&quot;smurf&quot;));
		Assert.AreEqual(&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;marklar&quot; + &quot;smurf&quot; + &quot;foo&quot;, acc(&quot;foo&quot;));
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is it good for?  Absolutely nothing!  But it sure was fun!&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>
<entry id='239' allow_comments='1' allow_pings='0' atom_id='tag:seankerwin.org,2009://1.239' author_id='1' authored_on='20090507165401' basename='constant_documentation' blog_id='1' class='entry' comment_count='0' convert_breaks='0' created_by='1' created_on='20090507170101' modified_by='1' modified_on='20091223141942' ping_count='0' status='2' title='Constant Documentation' week_number='200919'><text>&lt;p&gt;The only C++ feature I seriously miss in other languages is &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;.  Not in the simple &apos;this variable is a constant&apos; usage, where it&apos;s nothing but a type-checked #define &amp;mdash; no, I miss the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword in the interaction of &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; methods and &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First some background &amp;mdash; I don&apos;t expect folks who haven&apos;t spent time with C++ to know much about this, and a surprising number of veteran C++ coders seem to be unaware of it as well.  In C++, &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; can be many things.  One role is as a type modifier that means &quot;I&apos;m not going to change this&quot;.  A common usage is to accept a &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; references:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
int calculateAverage( const std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;amp; values );&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; means &quot;I&apos;m just going to look at it, I&apos;m not going to mutate it&quot; (or, if you like thinking functionally, &quot;I&apos;m a real function, hand me my immutable input&quot; &amp;mdash; more on that angle later).  What does that mean, in terms of actual code?  It means the body of that function can&apos;t call (for instance) &lt;code&gt;values.push_back( 12 )&lt;/code&gt; and mutate the data it was handed.  And when I say &quot;can&apos;t&quot; I don&apos;t mean &quot;shouldn&apos;t&quot;, I mean the compiler will actually flag that as an error and stop you.  If you keep trying it&apos;ll even call you names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now obviously the body of the function still needs a way to call methods on that vector &amp;mdash; it&apos;ll need some to get at the contents, whether it&apos;s running a for loop from zero to &lt;code&gt;values.size( )&lt;/code&gt; and calling &lt;code&gt;operator[]&lt;/code&gt; in between, or looping from &lt;code&gt;begin()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;end()&lt;/code&gt;, or whatever.  So what makes those methods okay, and &lt;code&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pop_back&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; and various other mutators verboten?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer (as you&apos;ve doubtless cleverly deduced already) is the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword.  In C++ &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; isn&apos;t just a type modifier for variables and parameters, it&apos;s also a permitted modifier on methods too.  The &lt;code&gt;size( )&lt;/code&gt; method on an array is declared like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
size_type size() const&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; means &quot;you can call me on a constant object, object reference, or object pointer!  I promise I&apos;m safe!&quot;.  And that isn&apos;t an idle promise, it&apos;s a promise enforced by the compiler.  If you declare a &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; method in a class and then try to alter member variables, the compiler&apos;s going to call it an error (unless that member is declared as volatile, but that&apos;s getting into advanced C++ and beyond what I&apos;m interested in talking about here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final crucial piece of the big, tasty, onst-in-C-plus-plus-pie is the fact that you can overload by &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;-ness.  The aforementioned &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; actually declares not one but &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;operator []&lt;/code&gt;s (or should that be &apos;&lt;code&gt;operator&lt;/code&gt;s &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;&apos;?), one of which returns a reference to the space in the underlying array, and one of which returns the simple value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&apos;s what I mean by &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; when I say &quot;I like &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; in C++&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual justification for this feature set is efficiency; the compiler can differentiate between &lt;code&gt;const operator[]&lt;/code&gt;, which returns a simple value, and non-&lt;code&gt;const operator[]&lt;/code&gt;, which must return either a reference to an internal data structure or a proxy object, neither of which is necessarily easy or fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But me, I like &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; for a different reason.  And that&apos;s documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backwards digression, the second: Defining the types and parameters of a function or method isn&apos;t a fundamental necessity; you could define a language where functions access the parameters they were passed by indexing into an array and assuming things are where they belong.  It&apos;s very easy to do this in JavaScript, for example &amp;mdash; the language doesn&apos;t verify parameters, and a function is free to get them out of the local &lt;code&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
function sayHello() {
	alert(&quot;Hello, &quot; + arguments[0] + &quot;!&quot;);
}
sayHello(&apos;World&apos;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons to specify type parameters; to tell the compiler the semantics of the function, and to tell the human reading the code the semantics of the function.  I&apos;m phrasing those in parallel for a reason, because they&apos;re two aspects of the same principle; function argument lists exist to document the code.  This just happens to be one of the (distressingly rare) cases where the documentation is so intrinsic to the language that we don&apos;t realize it&apos;s documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s something special in that.  Microsoft recognizes how important self-documenting code is; that&apos;s how &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense&quot;&gt;IntelliSense&lt;/a&gt; works, and I think you (or I, at least) could argue very plausibly that (a) the entire .NET architecture can be viewed as a means to improve and extend IntelliSense and (b) this may well represent Microsoft&apos;s biggest strategic advantage over its competitors.  The core idea that makes IntelliSense work is that the best documentation of the code is the implementation itself; the more information you can mine out of that, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The back-end of one of my employer&apos;s new (award-winning!) products is a suite of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer&quot;&gt;RESTful&lt;/a&gt; web service APIs.  One of the core parts of any such system is the routing engine; given the URI of an incoming request, how do we map that to the bunch of code that represents the appropriate response?  Our system uses XML-formatted resource maps that contain the information necessary to do that; a resource map contains not only URI paths, but the parameters to extract from those URI paths and the types of those parameters, as well as the required and optional query parameters and &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; types... it&apos;s pretty rich and pretty nifty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; nifty part is that I had a moment of insight one day and realized I could hardcode a mock resource into the router that ran the resource map through an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT&quot;&gt;XSL transformer&lt;/a&gt; and returned a pretty (or at least, legible) HTML page that documents the system.  Every URI, every parameter, all right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt; &amp;mdash; and this is the important bit &amp;mdash; &lt;i&gt;nobody ever has to worry about updating this documentation&lt;/i&gt;.  It&apos;s automatically derived from the actual implementation of the system; to add something new to the system, you need to add it to the resource map, and &lt;i&gt;bam&lt;/i&gt;, there it is in the help page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of implementation-derived documentation is the primary advantage that strong, static typing has over more dynamic approaches.  IntelliSense for a more dynamic language means your either execute the code as it&apos;s being typed and use real-time introspection (&lt;a href=&quot;http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/05/dynamic-languages-strike-back.html&quot;&gt;as proposed by Steve Yegge in a talk at Stanford&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; and probably other places, but that the first time I saw it in print) or you start trying to layer a more static type system on top of them.  Either way has its problems.  Running the code so you can IntelliSense it has sandboxing problems, particularly if you&apos;re doing anything that&apos;s concurrent or distributed, and laying a static type system on top of a dynamic type system is kind of an advanced, compiler-powered form of missing the point, if you ask me.  I have a lot of vaguely-connected thoughts on that last point that I should probably bundle together at some point.  The &lt;i&gt;Readers&apos; Digest&lt;/i&gt; version is that adding classes to JavaScript is like adding wheels to a unicycle, in that your &apos;addition&apos; has the unavoidable side effect of squashing what made the original unique.  But that&apos;s a rant for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages like C#, C++, and Java don&apos;t have those problems when it comes to rich syntax acting as embedded documentation.  It&apos;s still not easy, but it&apos;s a well-studied problem, and there&apos;s existing code you can point to and say &quot;here, here&apos;s where that feature goes!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is happening, albeit slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generics in Java are widely (and correctly) criticized for not being integrated into the VM the way .NET 2.0 generics are, but on the other hand they do serve as a form of compiler-checked documentation; &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; is of &lt;code&gt;Marklar&lt;/code&gt;s, and &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; is of &lt;code&gt;Widget&lt;/code&gt;s.  The compiler will force me to keep those types distinct, and I can look a method signature and know what it expects.  Yes, it&apos;s really just an annotation for the programmer and the compiler and doesn&apos;t actually change the generated code, but in a sense that&apos;s exactly the &lt;i&gt;point&lt;/i&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; in C++ doesn&apos;t change the generated code either most of the time, it&apos;s just letting programmers express both constraints and intent in a richer and more robust fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics of static typing frequently argue that it provides a false sense of security, and they&apos;re right to an extent.  But that doesn&apos;t mean that static typing is bad, it simply means that static typing is insufficient.  Choosing between compiler-powered semantic tests and human-written unit tests is akin to choosing between seat belts and airbags &amp;mdash; the &lt;i&gt;correct&lt;/i&gt; choice, anticlimactic though it may seem, is &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;bull; &amp;bull;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&apos;s my point?  Good languages let me do more than just write code, they let me codify what I expect my code to do and how I expect other code to call it.  It lets me express in a simple and clear form every assumption I&apos;m making, and then it explicitly checks my assumptions with all the thoroughness it can muster.  That&apos;s important today for writing good code, and it&apos;s only going to get more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine syntax-level support for concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are methods in the next version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/iclan&quot;&gt;iClan&lt;/a&gt; that are designed to only be called on the main thread; any time I want to activate them from elsewhere I call &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSObject_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSObject/performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:&quot;&gt;performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (boy that&apos;s a mouthful).  If Objective-C had syntax for concurrency, I could mark my methods as &apos;&lt;code&gt;mainthreadonly&lt;/code&gt;&apos;, and the compiler could stop me from calling them from elsewhere.  Or better yet, the compiler could note from the headers that the UI-related methods I&apos;m calling in those methods are &lt;code&gt;mainthreadonly&lt;/code&gt;, and from that &lt;i&gt;deduce&lt;/i&gt; which of my methods must be &lt;code&gt;mainthreadonly&lt;/code&gt;, and either warn me for not labeling them or just cascade the analysis all the way up the call graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar story:  I recently built a lockless queue in C#; it&apos;s built around &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2007/12/10/immutability-in-c-part-four-an-immutable-queue.aspx&quot;&gt;Eric Lippert&apos;s immutable queue&lt;/a&gt; code, and it uses &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.interlocked.compareexchange.aspx&quot;&gt;Interlocked.CompareExchange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to swap a new immutable value for the old immutable value (Or rather, it repeatedly &lt;i&gt;tries&lt;/i&gt; to make that swap, regenerating a &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; new immutable queue from the new old immutable queue if it fails... It&apos;s fun code, I should write about it someday &amp;mdash; it turns out not to be terribly &lt;i&gt;useful&lt;/i&gt;, but fun nonetheless.).  The exercise would&apos;ve been a lot easier on a lot of levels if C# gave the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword all the magic powers it has in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll notice both of those examples have a concurrency angle, and that&apos;s not a coincidence.  All of the self-anointed experts agree that the age of concurrency is upon us, and for a change the experts who &lt;i&gt;aren&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; self-anointed and are too smart and humble to actually &lt;i&gt;call&lt;/i&gt; themselves experts and the nobodies like myself seem to be in pretty general agreement with them.  And the thing about concurrency and distributed system is, well, they&apos;re hard.  Maybe not hard like &lt;i&gt;NP-hard&lt;/i&gt; hard, but still pretty bloody difficult.  And the more the compiler and the runtime and the VM and the OS can do to check our work for us, the better.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

I used to carry on lossy low-priority conversations with people via AIM status messages; it was a good way to say stuff that wasn&apos;t important enough to warrant a message and also to broadcast things in the vein of &quot;hey, here&apos;s a fun link&quot; without needing to directly spam people.

I&apos;m pretty sure this is roughly what the designers of Twitter had in mind, incidentally.  If you take a look at the XML or JSON feeds provided by the Twitter API, each individual tweet is actually called a &apos;status&apos; &amp;mdash; the URI for a particular tweet is &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/status/&amp;lt;some_big_number&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;OL&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element that contains the tweets on Twitter HTML page is of CSS class &apos;statuses&apos;... the list goes on.  Obviously the original intent of the tool doesn&apos;t define what the tool is actually used for &amp;mdash; I don&apos;t think AIM away messages were intended as an out-of-band communications protocol, at least at first &amp;mdash; but it&apos;s interesting nonetheless.

What&apos;s also interesting is that Twitter users seem to fall into two separate and largely non-overlapping groups.  Group A are people using it much like I am, as a non-ACKed broadcast medium for random thoughts that aren&apos;t important enough for a reliable messaging protocol like IM, email, or a blog post.  Group B are the people who see Twitter as a marketing/communication tool that will allow them to get the word out to members of Group A, for whatever value of &apos;the word&apos; is meaningful to them.

I see three ways this can go: either the two groups diverge completely and group B develops a self-sustaining ecosystem of their own; or group B recognizes that marketing in this context is futile and dwindles and dies; or group B is so persistent in their efforts that group A abandons Twitter and finds a new bicycle.

If you get the &apos;new bicycle&apos; thing, you&apos;re definitely in group A, though not getting it doesn&apos;t necessarily relegate you to group B.

But if you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; you&apos;re in group B and want to understand group A, then you should figure out what it means, why you don&apos;t get it, and what you can do to make sure you get to autotune the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; new bicycle... and then despair of ever marketing effectively on something like Twitter.</text></entry>

Your code sucks. 

It&apos;s okay though, so does everyone else&apos;s code, including mine.  But a big part of improving is recognizing what you&apos;re doing wrong, and a big part of that is having random bald guys berate you.  So in the spirit of improving the world, here are five thoughts on writing code that sucks less.  Heavily C#-centric because that&apos;s what I&apos;ve been reading lately, but I think most of it&apos;s meaningful in any environment modulo some terminological adjustments.

&lt;b&gt;1. Dumb Comments Are Dumb&lt;/b&gt;

A comment that doesn&apos;t say anything useful is worse than worthless; it&apos;s actively harmful.
	
If you have a property named Marklar with a comment telling me that it &apos;gets or sets the Marklar&apos;, you haven&apos;t told me anything of value, and reading your useless comment has cost me precious seconds of my life that I&apos;ll never get back.  You&apos;ve also probably raised my blood pressure a bit, but I suppose that&apos;s more on me than on you.

Now if a Marklar is an odd or confusing type of thing, and you can&apos;t reasonably expect everyone to know what it is or why it&apos;s there, by all means explain it.  Similarly, if this property has unusual behavior in some respect &amp;mdash; perhaps it&apos;s lazily loaded &amp;mdash; mention that in a comment.  But don&apos;t just put a bloody comment on every property because some never-been-employed professor once told you that that&apos;s the right thing to do.  It isn&apos;t.  If someone can&apos;t tell you that the &lt;code&gt;EyeColor&lt;/code&gt; property lets you get or set the color of the receiver&apos;s eyes, they have no business writing code in the first place.

You should only put comments where they&apos;re needed, and generally if a comment is legitimately needed it&apos;s a sign that you&apos;re writing bad code.  Don&apos;t name the property &lt;code&gt;Age&lt;/code&gt; and then add a comment explaining that it&apos;s in seconds; name it &lt;code&gt;AgeInSeconds&lt;/code&gt; and skip the comment entirely.  That saves &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; typing, saves &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; reading, and has the further benefit of being completely impossible for future programmers to miss unless they&apos;re severely mentally impaired (in which case, see above, they have no business writing code in the first place).

Similarly, if you feel compelled to add a comment explaining that the next five lines of code are stochastically approximating the chronosynclastic infundibulumation of the yada, yada... that&apos;s your sign that those five lines should be extracted into a method with an appropriate name like &apos;AproximateTechnobabble&apos;.  That makes it easier for me to read the original method because I can temporarily ignore the hard stuff, while also making it easier for me to understand the hard stuff later on if I need to (since it&apos;s now isolated with clear, labeled inputs).

Finally, dumb comments are dumb not just in the code, but everywhere.  If your checkin note is &quot;I changed the twelfth character of line 37 from an &apos;e&apos; to a &apos;z&apos;&quot;, you have so completely and cleanly missed the point of checkin notes that I can&apos;t even scrape together a proper disparaging simile.  Checkin notes are there so I can get a high-level understanding of what you&apos;ve checked in, &lt;i&gt;without having to open the bloody file&lt;/i&gt;.  &quot;Ran a match along a patch of bark&quot; is a lousy checkin note when what you actually did was &quot;burned down the forest&quot;.  Tell me about the forest, I couldn&apos;t care less about the &lt;i&gt;trees&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;2. Every Time You Type &apos;#region&apos; I Die A Little Inside&lt;/b&gt;

Regions suck.  If I were king I&apos;d ban &apos;em outright, so sincere and total is my dislike.  They&apos;re a trick you play on yourself to let you pretend that your bad code is good, and they tell the world that you&apos;re a good enough coder to know a three-thousand-line file stinks, but that you&apos;re either not good enough to fix it or you&apos;re just plain too lazy.  In either situation the solution is to step up, not to add a region and sweep part of the bad code under the rug.

A special note on regions &lt;i&gt;within methods&lt;/i&gt;: wrapping a region around your twelve constructors to hide the excess complexity is a venal sin.  Putting a region &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; your method to hide 3,000 of its 4,000 lines is a &lt;i&gt;mortal&lt;/i&gt; sin.

Some people might ask why extracting methods (like &lt;code&gt;AproximateTechnobabble&lt;/code&gt; above) is good but collapsing regions within a method is evil.  The simple answer is encapsulation; a region isn&apos;t a new scope, so it has access to all the fields and variables of the method it&apos;s within.  That greatly increases the difficulty of understanding the code, because now I need to actively read through and figure out how the code inside the region interacts with the code outside the region.  An extracted method doesn&apos;t have the problem, because I can look at exactly what parameters are passed in and exactly what comes out, without having to trace through and worry about side effects.  Regions superficially seem to simplify the complexity of your code; extracted methods &lt;i&gt;actually do&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;3. Static Methods Are Your Friends, And You Should Want More Of Them&lt;/b&gt;

Static methods are pure functions, in the mathematical sense; they&apos;re black boxes that take some input and return some output.  Remember where I said methods are better than regions because they simplify complexity?  The same logic recommends static methods over non-static methods.  Static methods help you make sure you&apos;re not weaving a tangled web of side effects and dependencies with each method call.  

Imagine coming upon a call to &lt;code&gt;myComplexMarklar.CalculateInfundibulumation()&lt;/code&gt;.  Now, if you don&apos;t know what infundibulumation is (incidentally, the state of being or the act of becoming funnel-like or akin to a funnel), and have no idea how you would calculate it (no idea), that method doesn&apos;t tell you a whole lot.  Now imagine stepping through that rather lengthy method and figuring out how it works.  You are potentially entering a world of pain.

Now imagine a static method, &lt;code&gt;Marklar.CalculateInfundibulumation(float topRadius, float bottomRadius, float height)&lt;/code&gt;, and further imagine that the non-static method works by calling the static method and passing along the three appropriate values.  It has instantly become a whole lot easier for me to understand what infundibulumation is, because now I know that no matter how gnarly the math is it&apos;s just a function of those three values.  Now not only can I better understand that particular method, but a lot of the meaning of the Marklar class in general has become more clear.

In an object-oriented language, every instance method is getting more parameters than you&apos;ve listed in the declaration line; it&apos;s also getting access to all of the instance&apos;s member fields.  Imagine seeing that written out &amp;mdash; would you deliberately write a method that takes a hundred parameters but only uses two of them?  That might be a good sign that it&apos;s time for some judiciously-applied static methods.

Static methods have other benefits.  For one, they&apos;re a lot more reusable; if the static &lt;code&gt;CalculateInfundibulumation( tR, bR, h )&lt;/code&gt; method is general, you might find you need it in another class.  Depending on your situation, you could either make it public and call it right out of Marklar, move it to a new common base class, or move it to a utility class.  Each of those solutions would be far more complicated if it were non-static.  I&apos;ve been in situations where I needed a complex non-static method from a pre-existing class that I couldn&apos;t reasonably modify, and ended up constructing an instance with a bunch of bogus data, setting the handful of fields that the calculation actually depends on, and calling the instance method on that.  That&apos;s hideous &amp;mdash; ugliness wrapped in brittleness wrapped in unmaintainable complexity.  Don&apos;t make me do that again.

Static methods also lend themselves incredibly well to a form of optimization known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization&quot;&gt;memoization&lt;/a&gt;.  The root of memoization is basically the realization that the next time you run the same calculation, you&apos;ll reach the same result (yeah, I know, &apos;duh&apos;, right?).  The tie-in to static methods is that static methods let you know precisely &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; the inputs are to the calculation you&apos;re running, while instance methods don&apos;t.  Memoizing a static method is &apos;easy&apos; (in the sense of being a solved problem), while memoizing instance methods can be a buggy pain in the butt.

&lt;u&gt;3b. Subverting Static Methods Is Bad And People Who Do It Should Be Forced To Write Pascal&lt;/u&gt;

Sometimes you&apos;ll see a static class, full of static fields and static variables and static methods.  That&apos;s not what I&apos;m talking about when I say static is good.  That&apos;s not good, it&apos;s the other thing.  Bad.  It&apos;s a crappy-ass degenerate-global-variable-singleton.  Don&apos;t do that.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/singleton-considered-stupid&quot;&gt;Smart people hate singletons&lt;/a&gt;.


&lt;b&gt;4. Properties Are Properties, Methods Are Methods&lt;/b&gt;

A property is intended to represent an attribute of an object, while a method models an action that the object may take or that may be taken upon the object.  These are different concepts, and you need to think about which is appropriate for a particular case.  If you have a property with a verb in the name, you&apos;re almost certainly thinking about things the wrong way.

Some people will tell you that properties should just be get/set wrappers around your fields.  Others will say it&apos;s okay to do some field validation.  Others go hog wild.  It&apos;s hard to draw bright lines because the simple fact is that it&apos;s sometimes a judgement call.  A good heuristic is to think like someone using your class.  The default assumption is that properties are simple get/set wrappers around a private field, and everything you do to violate that assumption nudges the scale towards building a method.

Let&apos;s say your class has a &lt;code&gt;ServerConnection&lt;/code&gt; property that returns some sort of communications channel to a remote server.  As a caller, my mindset is that this connection already exists, and the property is giving me access to it.  But if only a subset of the calling code ever needs this connection, it might make sense to lazily connect when the property is first accessed rather than connecting in the constructor and keeping around a connection that may never actually be needed.  But that&apos;s changing the semantics of the property a little bit, because the mindset of the calling code is still &apos;this already exists, the property is just handing it to me&apos;, and the calling code may not expect this property to take a long time to execute.  Maybe now there should be a progress bar, or the call should happen in another thread.

Like I said, judgement call.  In situations like that one, asking ten developers will get you fifteen different opinions.  There isn&apos;t a &apos;right&apos; answer, it&apos;s just a matter of getting it right enough.  All anyone can ask is that you think.

But in other cases, it&apos;s totally cut and dried.  I&apos;ve seen code with a LastSaveDate property that saves to the database and returns DateTime.Now.  If you&apos;re not physically ill at the thought of that, you need to figure why and &lt;i&gt;get sick fast&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;5. Public Methods Are Contracts, Which Should Not Be Entered Lightly&lt;/b&gt;

When you make a method public, you&apos;re inviting the world to use it and you&apos;re promising that it will continue to do exactly what it does now.  Forever.  

Let&apos;s say you&apos;re creating a &lt;code&gt;CarFactory&lt;/code&gt; class that creates new &lt;code&gt;Car&lt;/code&gt; objects.  &lt;code&gt;CarFactory.CreateCar( )&lt;/code&gt; was starting to get a little long, so you started extracting out helper methods: &lt;code&gt;CreateTransmission( )&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CreateBody( )&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CreateWheel( )&lt;/code&gt;, etc.  That&apos;s good, keep doing it.

Now let&apos;s say you decided that since &lt;code&gt;CreateCar( )&lt;/code&gt; was public that you might as well make &lt;code&gt;CreateTransmission( )&lt;/code&gt; &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; public too.  That&apos;s no-so-much with the good.  Unless you know right now that someone else needs to create a transmission without creating a full car, leave that method private.

To the calling code, a &lt;code&gt;CarFactory&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Car&lt;/code&gt; are black boxes.  The calling code doesn&apos;t need to know that a car contains a transmission, and next year when you change &lt;code&gt;CarFactory&lt;/code&gt; and Car to build fully-electric vehicles, which don&apos;t &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; a transmission, you won&apos;t have to worry about supporting that public method that a bunch of your coworkers have just spent twelve months linking against.

There&apos;s a more general lesson here: Share the hot dog, not the making thereof.

Which, come to think of it, is a good moral on which to end any story.</text></entry>

Everything&apos;s pretty scrupulously iPhone-friendly this time around (that&apos;s actually what got me started on Xclan again, figuring out how to work with UDP CFSockets in a run loop), but as I understand it uploading new text textures every few frames will bog an iPhone down pretty quickly.  I&apos;m thinking of switching my NSOpenGLView to a CAOpenGLLayer and putting a bunch of CATextLayers on top for the bubbles.

There&apos;s actually an NSTextField in a layer in the game window; on Leopard it floats above the NSOpenGLView, but in Snow Leopard (where the screen shots were taken) it&apos;s invisible.  I haven&apos;t pursued it because I was planning on replacing the OGL view with a layer anyway, but it&apos;s a strange difference.</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous function calls seem, at first blush, only a little more difficult &amp;mdash; instead of calling &lt;code&gt;DoSomething()&lt;/code&gt; and executing your follow-up code after it returns, you pass in a callback: &lt;code&gt;BeginDoSomething( Action callback )&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, problem solved, let&apos;s go home.  Unless you need a return value, that is.  But even then it seems simple; to turn a synchronous method like &lt;code&gt;int CalculateSomething( )&lt;/code&gt; into an asynchronous method, you just pass it a delegate that takes a parameter: &lt;code&gt;void BeginCalculateSomething( Action&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; callback )&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is that it?  Nope.  Because all of that is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the original &lt;code&gt;DoSomething( )&lt;/code&gt; method had no return type, it still had a return &lt;i&gt;path&lt;/i&gt; &amp;mdash; it could throw an exception.  Let&apos;s imagine that &lt;code&gt;BeginDoSomething&lt;/code&gt; looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
public void BeginDoSomething(Action callback)
{
    PrepareForLongRunningOperation( );
    
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(
        delegate
            {
                LongRunningOperation();

                callback();
            });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A handy way to think about this sort of thing is to figure out where a thrown exception would emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If something goes wrong within the call to &lt;code&gt;PrepareForLongRunningOperation&lt;/code&gt;, that happens in the same context as the calling code &amp;mdash; any exceptions will throw up to the calling code and come out of its call to &lt;code&gt;BeginDoSomething&lt;/code&gt;.  The same applies to the call to &lt;code&gt;ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; no problem there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if &lt;code&gt;LongRunningOperation&lt;/code&gt; throws?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LongRunningOperation&lt;/code&gt; would throw up into whatever internal part of the ThreadPool implementation actually launched it.  That exception can&apos;t come out of &lt;code&gt;ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem&lt;/code&gt;, because by the time the asynchronous anonymous delegate is running &lt;code&gt;ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem&lt;/code&gt; has already returned.  And since the exception can&apos;t come out of &lt;code&gt;ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem&lt;/code&gt;, it also can&apos;t come out of &lt;code&gt;BeginDoSomething&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; which means there&apos;s no way for the calling code to get the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main approaches to this problem &amp;mdash; error handlers and completion calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Error Handlers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of passing your begin method one callback, pass two: a callback to be invoked if everything goes to plan, and an exception-accepting callback to which errors will be passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
public void BeginDoSomething(Action callback, Action&amp;lt;Exception&amp;gt; errorHandler)
{
    PrepareForLongRunningOperation( );
    
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(
        delegate
            {
                try
                {
                    LongRunningOperation();
                    callback();
                }
                catch(Exception ex)
                {
                    errorHandler(ex);
                }
            });
}

// Sample usage:

BeginDoSomething(
    delegate
    {
		// Do something now that we&apos;re done
    },
    delegate(Exception ex)
    {
		// Do something with the error
    });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are strengths and weaknesses to this approach.  The biggest strength of this model is that it &lt;i&gt;forces&lt;/i&gt; the calling code to think about error handling &amp;mdash; the prompt for it is right there in the method signature.  Error handling tends to fall through the cracks in any sort of code, but it&apos;s especially easy to overlook in an asynchronous context (It&apos;s also a lot more dangerous in an asynchronous context, because often dropping a callback invocation will cause a process to spin forever, sucking down resources and accomplishing nothing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separating the success case from the failure case may be either a strength or a weakness, depending on the particular task.  Sometimes it makes your code much cleaner, but it often happens that your success and error handler need to share context and implementation, which can make for some very ugly code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Completion Calls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of just invoking a parameter-less &lt;code&gt;Action&lt;/code&gt; callback or a single-parameter &lt;code&gt;Action&amp;lt;TReturn&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; callback, your code calls a single-parameter callback and passes it an &lt;code&gt;Action&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;TReturn&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that the callback in turn invokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
public void BeginDoSomething(Action&amp;lt;Action&amp;gt; callback)
{
    PrepareForLongRunningOperation( );
    
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(
        delegate
            {
                try
                {
                    LongRunningOperation();
                    callback(delegate { });
                }
                catch(Exception ex)
                {
                    callback(delegate { throw ex; });
                }
            });
}

// Sample Usage:

BeginDoSomething(
    delegate(Action complete)
    {
        try
        {
            complete();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Do something with the error
            return;
        }
        // Do something now that we&apos;re done
	})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first blush, this seems like a much clumsier solution; you&apos;re essentially trusting the calling code to call your completion method.  That&apos;s true, at least in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where completion calls really shine are for asynchronous calls returning values; instead of calling their callback and handing in an &lt;code&gt;Action&lt;/code&gt;, you call their callback and give it a &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;TReturn&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which they then &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; invoke to get their result.  That gives you an opportunity to throw exceptions that they &lt;i&gt;can&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; cleverly bypass:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
public void BeginCalculateSomething(Action&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;gt; callback)
{
    PrepareForLongRunningCalculation();

    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(
        delegate
        {
            try
            {
                int result = LongRunningCalculation();
                callback(() =&amp;gt; result);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                callback(delegate { throw ex; });
            }
        });
}

// Sample Usage:

BeginCalculateSomething(
    delegate(Func&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; complete)
    {
        int result;
        try
        {
            result = complete();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Do something with the error
            return;
        }
        // Do something with the content of result;
	})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I prefer completion calls, mainly because the the pattern works so well for return values.  In practice, any time you need this sort of a pattern it&apos;s because you care about return values; if you need to ensure that X happens after Y, it&apos;s generally because X depends on the result of Y.  If X &lt;i&gt;doesn&apos;t&lt;/i&gt; depend on Y, that&apos;s often a sign that you&apos;re being too linear in your analysis and that the tasks should be happening in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft seems to have collectively reached the same conclusion; &lt;code&gt;IHttpAsyncHandler&lt;/code&gt;, the asynchronous methods off of &lt;code&gt;SqlCommand&lt;/code&gt;, and the asynchronous forms of &lt;code&gt;WebRequest&lt;/code&gt; all use the completion call approach.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

And as long as we&apos;re imagining, take it a step further: they can get it for you for no extra cost, absolutely &lt;i&gt;instantly&lt;/i&gt;.

So that&apos;s the way video rentals work, and they all stock VHS cassettes, and that&apos;s that.  But now a sea change occurs: somebody invents DVDs.  All of the video rental shops start building their stock of DVD titles, and while doing so they take advantage of their affiliation network, so if your favored shop doesn&apos;t have &lt;i&gt;Joe Dirt&lt;/i&gt; on DVD, they can get it from the shop across town.

But one little shop bucks the trend &amp;mdash; even though DVD is the future, they decide to stick with VHS.  And that works out okay for them, because while the other rental shops are investing heavily in building a DVD library, they&apos;re making room by selling off their VHS cassettes, and this little dark-horse shop is gobbling them up like popcorn, and their library is &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt;.

Now it&apos;s ten years later.  Every video rental shop around the world has switched to DVD, but this little shop is still on VHS.  It&apos;s impossible to buy a VHS deck in stores, so this shop rents or sells you a VHS player when you sign up for membership, but that&apos;s okay actually &amp;mdash; some people find that kind of convenient.

But now something interesting happens &amp;mdash; a big, new, &lt;i&gt;hit&lt;/i&gt; movie comes out... but only for DVD.  This little shop is caught-flat footed, because they simply can&apos;t compete here.  So what do they do?  They advertise!

This shop starts running ads, talking about how the local Blockbuster has a &lt;i&gt;tiny&lt;/i&gt; library of titles, and it&apos;s absolutely terrible how small their library is.  Now, in a sense that&apos;s true; any individual Blockbuster may have a small library available, but keep in mind the affiliate network &amp;mdash; when you get a DVD at Blockbuster, you may be getting it from any one of dozens of DVD rental places all over the world.

---

So what does any of that have to do with anything?

Well, VHS is the creaky old CDMA digital cellular technology.  DVDs are GSM, the modern cellular network architecture that almost every cellular carrier &lt;i&gt;around the world&lt;/i&gt; uses.  Our hit DVD is obviously the iPhone.

And the tiny dark-horse video shop, that&apos;s Verizon.

Now, don&apos;t read this as a defense of AT&amp;amp;T.  Personally I haven&apos;t had all that much trouble with them, but I know plenty of people who reflexively spit upon hearing those letters, and it&apos;s pretty clear that AT&amp;T has been using their iPhone windfall to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2000/10/23/&quot;&gt;money hats&lt;/a&gt; rather than investing in their network infrastructure, and that&apos;s clearly subpar.  But while I dislike incompetence and don&apos;t care for spin, I absolutely &lt;i&gt;loathe&lt;/i&gt; deception, and that&apos;s what Verizon&apos;s &apos;map&apos; ads amount to, in my opinion.

The &apos;Verizon map&apos; in those ads is, &lt;i&gt;by necessity&lt;/i&gt;, a map of Verizon-owned-and-operated coverage zones; they &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to be Verizon-owned-and-operated, because nobody else is running CDMA these days, just like nobody&apos;s using VHS or Windows 95.  The &apos;AT&amp;amp;T map&apos; to which they compare themselves, meanwhile, is of AT&amp;amp;T-owned-and-operated coverage areas, which is not at all representative because AT&amp;amp;T has reciprocal carriage agreements with GSM carriers throughout the US, and roaming agreements with GSM carriers &lt;i&gt;around the world&lt;/i&gt;.

Personally, I can&apos;t stand Verizon &amp;mdash; they have a policy of installing Verizon-controlled firmware on every phone they support, which tends to cripple the phone by removing built-in features to encourage you to use Verizon&apos;s expensive and inferior network-based equivalents.  Ever try to copy a ringtone to your Verizon phone using standard Bluetooth file transfer?  If you did, I&apos;m betting it didn&apos;t go so well.  But Verizon does have a lot to offer customers, and if they want to be taken seriously they should compete by explaining the benefits of Verizon rather than deceiving people about the non-deficiencies of their competitors.</text></entry>

Teenagerititude is the state of believing that everyone else in the world is phenomenally stupid &amp;mdash; that the solution to every problem is blatantly obvious, and that everyone would be much better off if they&apos;d just shut up and do as you say.

The interesting thing about being a teenager is that you don&apos;t actually outgrow it.

At some point a light goes on in your mind, the scales drop from your eyes, the metaphor similes upon you, &lt;i&gt;whatever&lt;/i&gt;, and you realize you&apos;ve been a teenager and you stop.  You congratulate yourself on being so adult and on owning up to your past bad acts and you move on with your life.

And then a few years later you realize that you were mistaken, that you were actually still a very-slightly-more-evolved form of teenager despite that revelation, and the scales drop from  your lights and you eye what you metaphor and you move on with your life.

Until it happens &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;.

Eventually you reach a degree of meta-awareness &amp;mdash; you recognize that Socrates kinda had a point about the whole &apos;knowing you know nothing&apos; schtick.  That&apos;s when you ascend to a higher plane of existence!  Then you help Teal&apos;c and MacGuyver out a few times, and eventually you return to the show with your tail between your legs because it turns out your landlord won&apos;t accept &apos;art&apos; in lieu of money.  But hey, higher power.  You got &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; going for you.

Until, damn it, it happens &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;.

Meta ain&apos;t enough, nor is meta-meta.  Maybe there&apos;s some omega-meta state where you stop realizing that you&apos;re an idiot, and you get to draw a Batman logo on Anthro&apos;s cave wall just to reassure the idiots who didn&apos;t figure out the pattern based on Kal and Hal and whatnot.  But I can&apos;t be sure of that.  I think any form of personal growth boils down to suddenly recognizing what a jackass you&apos;ve been and thus becoming an exciting &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; form of jackass.

...

So what&apos;s the moral of the story?  The moral is that I&apos;m stupid, you&apos;re stupid, he&apos;s stupid, she&apos;s stupid, and the primary differentiating point between us is our awareness of our own incompetence.  So when something looks dumb to you, remember that it either &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; dumb, or it&apos;s smart in a way you haven&apos;t thought yet deciphered &amp;mdash; and prudence dictates that you assume the latter until you&apos;ve assembled reasonable support for the former.  And even if something turns out to be legitimately dumb, don&apos;t draw conclusions from that, because oftentimes there&apos;s more to the story.  It&apos;s not uncommon to find clever implementations of a piss-poor design; that may be a sign of abstractional schizophrenia, or it may be a sign of the blind leading the brilliant.


*&lt;i&gt;If you currently are a teenager, shut up and get the hell off my lawn.  Damned kids.&lt;/i&gt;</text></entry>

The question has a number of rather pertinent ramifications.  It&apos;s good to have an answer.

If your company is a &lt;i&gt;family&lt;/i&gt;, then when you invade my workspace for a family activity, preventing me from getting any work done and thereby causing me to miss deadlines and slip schedules, well, that&apos;s okay.  We&apos;re family.  We&apos;ll deal.  Pass the cake.

If, on the other hand, your company is a &lt;i&gt;company&lt;/i&gt;, then when you invade my workspace for a family activity &amp;mdash; preventing me from getting any work done and thereby causing me to miss deadlines and slip schedules &amp;mdash; it&apos;s on &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; to make up the time.  Your actions have become &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; problems, which is ample justification for me to be more than a little peeved.

So is your company a company, or is your company a family?

If your company is like &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; companies, it&apos;s both &amp;mdash; you get to do what you want, and I get screwed with no right to be angry about it.

Here&apos;s a protip about &apos;most companies&apos; &amp;mdash; people good enough to get jobs elsewhere... &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;.</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;As the story goes, Catherine&apos;s inspection took the form of a leisurely cruise down the Dniper River.  Potemkin, being aware that the Crimea was kind of a crummy area and fearful that the Tsarina would mislike the realization that her new territory kinda sucked, ordered the hasty construction of numerous fake village façades along the river bank.  The illusion held; Catherine went home thinking the Crimea was a bustling hub of non-squalid not-mud, and our modern world gained a vivid new idiom: &apos;Potempkin Villages&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course all the actual evidence is that the story is bunk &#8212; Potemkin may have instructed the peasants to clean up a bit and maybe paint some fences, but the idea that the whole area was an elaborate set was an extreme exaggeration spread by his political rivals.  But it&apos;s one of those stories that&apos;s just too good to not tell, isn&apos;t it?  It&apos;s &apos;truthy&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing direction entirely: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing&quot;&gt;unit testing&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120912/quotes&quot;&gt;the new hotness&lt;/a&gt; in software development.  The basic idea is that you decompose your software into small, manageable units and create dedicated automated tests that verify the functionality of those units.  And it is, in general, a really good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem that crops up with unit tests is that some things are just really hard to test, particularly when your code interacts with something outside your control &#8212; such as a human user, a piece of hardware, or a third-party web service.  In those cases you need to get tricky; you create new layers of abstraction that separate the interaction from the main work of your module, and then you create &apos;mock&apos; version of those abstraction layers and substitute in a &apos;simulated user&apos; for a real user, or a &apos;simulated serial port&apos; for your hardware, or a &apos;simulated web service&apos; for the third-party service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases that approach may make sense.  For some pieces of hardware the range of possible states is limited; a button is up or down, and it&apos;s never both.  If a user is given an extremely limited set of buttons to click, you can reasonably simulate every possible interaction model.  But for anything more complex, you&apos;re kind of creating a Potemkin unit test.  So you&apos;ve extracted out an &lt;code&gt;ITwitterApiProxy&lt;/code&gt; that your &lt;code&gt;TwitterService&lt;/code&gt; talks to, and you can plug in your &lt;code&gt;MockTwitterApiProxy&lt;/code&gt; and write a whole host of tests for your &lt;code&gt;TwitterService&lt;/code&gt;.  Every failure mode you can think of can be simulated by the &lt;code&gt;MockTwitterApiProxy&lt;/code&gt; and you&apos;ve coded the &lt;code&gt;TwitterService&lt;/code&gt; to deal with all of them reasonably &#8212; and hurray, the unit tests mean you&apos;re safe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you go to production, with the &lt;code&gt;RealTwitterApiProxy&lt;/code&gt;, and stuff goes wrong.  Twitter&apos;s failing in ways you never anticipated!  So you add more switches and dials to your &lt;code&gt;MockTwitterApiProxy&lt;/code&gt;, and add more code to your &lt;code&gt;TwitterService&lt;/code&gt; to deal with them, and write tests to exercise them... and hurray, the unit tests mean you&apos;re safe!  ...at least until Twitter fails in another new way you haven&apos;t seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare that to how you would have handled things without unit tests: You code up &lt;code&gt;TwitterService&lt;/code&gt;, handle the error cases you anticipate, go to production and discover some more error cases, update &lt;code&gt;TwitterService&lt;/code&gt; to handle them... lather, rinse, repeat.  It&apos;s essentially the same workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does the extra effort buy you?  What&apos;s the benefit of building your API abstraction and unit tests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the obvious answer is that it buys you protection against regression.  You have an explicit test in place for handling error type A, so if in the course of implementing support for type G errors you accidentally break type A, the unit test will fail and you&apos;ll find out.  There&apos;s that, certainly.  Without unit tests it&apos;s basically down to trust: I trust myself (or my fellow developers) not to break &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; part of the code while working on &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; part of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, your test for handling error type A isn&apos;t &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; testing your handling of error type A, it&apos;s testing your handling of your mock simulation of error type A.  How can you be sure that in the course of adding code to simulate error G to your mock you didn&apos;t accidentally break the code that simulates error type A?  Isn&apos;t that the same sort of &quot;trust yourself&quot; approach that the non-unit-testing approach is left to?  Should you add unit tests for your mocks to ensure that they&apos;re properly simulating errors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately a lot of this is down to personal judgement, like most of the interesting questions in software development.  And I&apos;m certainly not going to argue that unit tests aren&apos;t a good idea a lot of the time.  But I do believe that there are certain situations where unit tests create a lot of extra code to maintain without really adding much in the way of protection, and that committing to building such Potemkin unit tests is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bartleby.com/100/420.47.html&quot;&gt;a foolish consistency&lt;/a&gt; of precisely the sort that will prove &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobgoblin_(comics)&quot;&gt;a poor substitute for Norman Osborn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

As Sony doubtless expected, it entered my home as a shiny black Trojan horse, and I&apos;ve bought a handful of games since then.

Including, fatefully &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.playstation.com/flow/&quot;&gt;one from the Playstation Network&lt;/a&gt; (link goes to a Flash-only site, because Sony&apos;s just in full-on pissing-me-off mode at the moment).

If you&apos;re reading this there&apos;s roughly a 99% probability that you already know that the PSN has been &apos;out&apos; for nearly a week, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/26/update-on-playstation-network-and-qriocity/&quot;&gt;latest news from Sony&lt;/a&gt; is that it ain&apos;t comin&apos; back anytime soon, and oh, by the way, some hackers probably have your credit card numbers.

I know this the same way you do, through the magical collaborative power of the Internet.  Not, say, from an email sent to me by Sony warning me that my credit card number had been stolen.  Strike one, Sony.  You assholes.

But as annoying &amp;mdash; and probably &lt;i&gt;actionable&lt;/i&gt; &amp;mdash; as their failure to proactively warn their customers may be, that&apos;s not what really pisses me off.

No, what&apos;s really bugging me is that I can&apos;t use Netflix on my PS3.

Why?  Because Netflix on the PS3 &amp;mdash; despite being tied to my totally independent non-Sony Netflix account &amp;mdash; requires a PSN login to function.  For no reason at all except that Sony are a bunch of goddamned morons.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/archives/2004/10/remember.shtml&quot;&gt;I&apos;ve said it before&lt;/a&gt;, and I&apos;ll say it again: the Bush War on Terror was never about hunting down bin Laden.  To view it in that light is to characterize it as a campaign of retribution rather than one of pre-emptive self defense.  It is a simplistic and reductionist misrepresentation favored primarily by those who opposed Bush in every fashion, and it&apos;s a straw man that we would all do well to stop stuffing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people make the world better through their existence, some make it worse, and the vast majority of us largely break even.  Osama bin Laden was clearly in the &apos;worse&apos; column, and in that sense the world is a better place with him a corpse.  But to claim that his death in any measurable way makes us safer or surer or more just is folly.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

&lt;p&gt;I play &lt;a href=&quot;http://clanlord.com&quot;&gt;Clan Lord&lt;/a&gt;, a multiplayer online RPG.  Clan Lord provides a lot of ways for players to customize their characters&apos; appearance, including a system for changing shirt and pants colors with an algorithmic dye and bleach system.  Experimenting with dyes and bleaches in-game can be prohibitive &amp;mdash; each application consumes in-game currency and (often rare) materials.  As a result, there&apos;s a long tradition of external dye-simulation tools; the earliest was Stylus (named in the &apos;function-us&apos; pattern of many Clan Lord NPCs), followed by Stylos, the OS X re-imagining of Stylus.  Stylos didn&apos;t work well on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, so in 2005 I built the first version of Stylunk as a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then the number one Stylunk-related request has been for a Windows version, and the number two request is &apos;hey, add this new shirt color!&apos;.  Both of which were difficult enough to fill that they happened never (Windows version) and only intermittently.  So I&apos;ve decided to simplify cross-platform concerns and centralize updating by turning Stylunk into a web app.  The beta is &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/stylunk-beta/&quot;&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/stylunk-beta/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/stylunk-screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; height=&quot;483&quot; alt=&quot;Stylunk Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palettized recoloring in JavaScript&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;&apos;the actual non-background stuff about which I plan to write&apos;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing Clan Lord in 1998 and it had already been in development for a while at that point, so it shouldn&apos;t be a surprise that the tech isn&apos;t exactly modern.  Images in Clan Lord are an run-length-encoded list of indices into a per-image color map, which itself contains indices into the &apos;Mac standard&apos; 256 color map.  That&apos;s all pretty integral to Clan Lord, because character customization is implemented as a set of 20 color overrides for the per-image colormap: indices zero and one contain the highlight and shadow colors for the character&apos;s hair, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images for a particular icon are arranged into a single 16x3 sprite sheet, comprising the 32 standing/walking/running sprites in eight cardinal directions as well as a &apos;dead&apos; sprite and fifteen &apos;poses&apos; that players can activate to emote.  Here&apos;s what the &apos;Ghorak Zo&apos; sprite sheet looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/zo-sprite-sheet.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/images/zo-sprite-sheet-shrunk.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; alt=&quot;Ghorak Zo Sprite Sheet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first stab at implementing web Stylunk was about what you&apos;d expect: I converted each of the sprite sheets into PNG files and wrote code that draws the selected sprite into a canvas, iterates across the pixels, and replaces the &apos;default&apos; colors with the mapped values calculated from the current UI selection.  Then I created a smaller canvas, copied the frame I needed from the large canvas to the small canvas, and used &lt;code&gt;toDataURL()&lt;/code&gt; to extract something that I could stick into the &lt;code&gt;background-image&lt;/code&gt; of my buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all worked fairly well, at least at first.  On my main machine (a Core i7 Mac Mini) everything was peachy.  On my MacBook Air, it was sluggish.  On my iPad... well, the less said the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate response was to try some very aggressive caching, leading to the creation of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/archives/2011/12/a_simple_javascript_least-rece.shtml&quot;&gt;reusable JavaScript least-recently-used cache&lt;/a&gt;.  That helped, but not as much as I&apos;d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next thought was: I&apos;m doing more work than I need to: there&apos;s no point colorizing the entire sprite sheet and then only displaying a single frame of it.  So I swapped things around; first extract a small canvas from the larger, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; recolor only the smaller canvas.  That helped too, but it was still pretty logey on the iPad.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there&apos;s no way to profile JavaScript in MobileSafari.  But desktop Safari &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have a profiler, and it showed something interesting: the slowest part of the process was reading the pixels out of the initial canvas.  So I took a cue from Clan Lord and took a step back in time: instead of storing the images as PNG sprite sheets, I wrote a tool that converts each frame of the sheet into a JavaScript data structure containing a run-length encoded bunch of pixel indices.  That way I can skip the &apos;reading from canvas&apos; step, and jump straight to writing them.  I also took the step of storing each frame as a separate JavaScript file which the main app loads on-demand via &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;, which simplifies the caching a lot by letting the browser do the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re curious, you can take a look at the code for a sprite &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/stylunk-beta/sprite-js-2/453/0_0.js&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  That&apos;s my JS-encoded version of the male Ghorak Zo facing east &amp;mdash; the top-left sprite in the image above.  Yup! &amp;mdash; despite being larger than a PNG representation or the same image, and despite needing to be parsed by the JavaScript engine, it &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; ends up being faster than reading data back from a canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is that Stylunk runs at a usable speed on my iPad (first-gen) and on my iPhone 4, which is good enough for me.  There are still some minor inefficiencies as a result of the tortured path to the current architecture &amp;mdash; if I were doing this from scratch there would also be JavaScript representations of the character color maps, which would simplify the color mapping process and also allow me to easily draw characters using the color map data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://deltatao.com/clanlord/status/cldata.xml&quot;&gt;XML data feed&lt;/a&gt; powering &lt;a href=&quot;http://deltatao.com/clanlord/status/&quot;&gt;the Clan Lord Informer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://seankerwin.org/iclan/&quot;&gt;iClan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m actually half-tempted to do that, because it would provide a starting point for building a &lt;a href=&quot;http://socket.io/&quot;&gt;Socket.IO&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;-powered HTML5 Clan Lord client.  But that&apos;s a headache for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</text></entry>

Air conditioning &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; to me like more than a modern convenience.  It&apos;s the sort of thing that I expect every freestanding structure to have, and the lack of AC is to me as disconcerting as the lack of electricity must have seemed in the near-recent past, when &apos;everyone&apos; had it but &lt;i&gt;literally everyone&lt;/i&gt; didn&apos;t yet have it.

AC is about more than cooling; it&apos;s about your air being cleaned and circulated.  Your air is, for lack of a better word, &lt;i&gt;conditioned&lt;/i&gt;.  It gives me a feeling of protection to know that a building is relatively air-tight and that the oxygen supply is being regulated.  There&apos;s a wild, untamed outside, where the insects and arthropods and germs and smoke and pollution and other anarchist elements can have their day, and there&apos;s the nice, soothing, controlled &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; where I can have my books and WiFi and TiVo and peace and quiet.  It&apos;s a wall.

A largely illusory and highly ineffective wall, to be sure.  But it&apos;s making a stand; drawing a line.  Out there: chaos; in here: the homey disordered order that defines my comfort zone.

And of course in asserting all this, I know full well that I&apos;m being silly.  I sound like a science fiction cliché &amp;mdash; one of Asimov&apos;s bubble-dwellers who refuse to believe the world outside is even habitable, of perhaps someone out of &lt;i&gt;Brave New World&lt;/i&gt;.  And while I can recognize intellectually that I am &amp;mdash; on this point at least, and possibly on many others &amp;mdash; stark raving mad, that doesn&apos;t in any way negate the underlying impulse.  Knowing I&apos;m crazy doesn&apos;t make me sane, it just makes me annoyed at the insufferably buggy firmware with which God or evolution or &lt;a href=&quot;http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Engineer&quot;&gt;the Engineers&lt;/a&gt; has saddled me.

As the first-line screener, my job is basically to do a sanity check and make sure that you meet the baseline we&apos;re looking for, so that we don&apos;t waste our time and your time with further interviews that aren&apos;t going anywhere. I see you&apos;ve got an impressive resume and a lengthy career, so please don&apos;t be offended if my questions seem simple; it&apos;s not ajudgementon you, but a reflection of the goal here. Any questions? No? Good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So here&apos;s my first questions: What&apos;s one plus one?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Loser answer number 1:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Geez&amp;hellip; I don&apos;t think anybody&apos;s asked me to add one and one since elementary school. Is that really something you do? I&apos;ve been working in this field for twenty years now, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had to know one plus one even once&amp;hellip; any competent professional has Excel, or a calculator, or &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;that will take care of details like that for them. I&apos;d go so far as to say that anybody who&apos;s manually adding single digit integers like that probably should be fired.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Loser answer number 2:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, I remember this one! I haven&apos;t actually done one plus one since kindergarten, but I studied up on the basics before this interview, and I remember that the answer is two. Here, let me write a two for you&amp;hellip; It&apos;s kind of curvy around the top, I think, like this&amp;hellip; no, more like&amp;hellip; here we are, that&apos;s a two.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Loser answer number 3:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Eleven. Yes, I&apos;m sure. No, there are no problems with my answer. You put the two ones next to each other, and it&apos;s eleven. What the hell is wrong with you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humor here&apos;s pretty obvious, right? No reasonable person misses the fundamental problem with these answers, I hope. Any yet if you shift the field to computer science, suddenly people think these sorts of shenanigans are reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course nobody would implement &lt;code&gt;ELEMENTARY_DATA_STRUCTURE_1&lt;/code&gt; by hand in this day and age; it&apos;s in the standard library on any platform worth dealing with (well&amp;hellip; maybe not Cocoa&amp;hellip;) and the folks writing the library probably spent a lot more time debugging and optimizing than you&apos;ll ever be able to devote. You don&apos;t get asked to implement these things because the interviewer&apos;s going to steal your code and check it in to source control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you also don&apos;t get asked because, gosh darn it, we totally need an idiot with an eidetic memory who can vomit code snippets he doesn&apos;t understand. We have Google for that! We&apos;re not testing your memory, but your ability to understand basic computer science principles and - gasp - write code! If you don&apos;t have the code paged into memory right now, from our perspective that&apos;s a HUGE WIN. We want to watch you re-derive things from fundamentals, not regurgitate all over &lt;a href=&quot;http://collabedit.com/&quot;&gt;Collabedit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </text></entry>

One morning, as he was standing guard at the drawbridge to his lord&apos;s castle, a brigand came down the road and attempted to pass by him.  As was his knightly duty, he silently drew his sword and blocked the brigand&apos;s path.  His lord was quite wealthy and the castle was elsewise undefended, and brigands frequently made halfhearted attacks at fighting their way past him into the castle.  But he was a formidable knight, and none could best him in battle.

&quot;Hello!&quot; exclaimed the brigand, nodding vigorously.  &quot;I appreciate your diligence!  Marvelous security!&quot;.

The knight cocked his head and let out a perplexed grunt despite himself.  This was not, in his experience, typical brigand behavior.

The brigand, meanwhile, was nearly vibrating with excitement: &quot;Yes, I appreciate it a great deal!  The safety of my castle is paramount, and I&apos;m quite glad to see you doing your duty.&quot;

The knight was so surprised he dropped his fierce mien and let slip the first word that came to mind: &quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, I do appreciate a go-getter.  We&apos;ll get on well!&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m afraid you must be under some form of misapprehension, sir.  This is in fact the castle of my great lord, and I am his defender.  Now be on your way!&quot;

&quot;Marvelous, marvelous!&quot; exclaimed the not-at-all-ordinary brigand.  &quot;Well said, well said.  Except: I&apos;ve here a document, saying that this castle is in fact *not* the property of your lord, but rather my property.&quot;

A moment passed.

&quot;Pardon?&quot; asked the knight.

This was news to him, and he was by now so wrong-footed he had quite forgotten to be fierce.

&quot;Yes, it&apos;s all in here I&apos;m afraid,&quot; replied the brigand, waving a large leather-bound tome around somewhat negligently.  &quot;You see, the last will and testament of your lord&apos;s great-great grandfather contained a clause stipulating some rather complex rules for succession.&quot;  The brigand&apos;s voice dropped as he added in a proud, conspiratorial whisper: &quot;It&apos;s taken quite some time to un-puzzle it in fact.&quot;

The brigand went on to explain that the heavy, bound document was in fact the will in question, and that it contained a lengthy series of complex puzzles, clues, quizzes, and codes that specified how the great-great-grand-lord&apos;s property was to be disbursed.  He shared with the knight the bundled papers on which he had sought to solve the mystery, and helped walk him through the complex reasoning that led the man to his claim of ownership.  The two sat together for hours, poring over the complex question and seeking the truth of the puzzle.

The sun was slipping lower in the sky when finally the knight arose in triumph and let out a cry of excitement.

&quot;Aha!  I see it!&quot;  he exclaimed.  &quot;You&apos;ve absolutely right in your solution to the puzzle on page seven... but your erred slightly in the acrostic on page nineteen, which means your inferred clues to the quiz on page eighty-one led to an incorrect code for deciphering page one-hundred-eleven!  The castle is still the property of my lord!&quot;

The brigand&apos;s face fell as he frantically flipped through pages and verified the knight&apos;s objection.

&quot;You&apos;re absolutely right,&quot; he finally admitted.  &quot;I guess I&apos;d best go.  Thank you for your patience!&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied the knight, genuinely pleased to have resolved the sticky issue and already looking forward to the praise his lord would doubtless heap upon him for his diligence.  &quot;Not at all!&quot;

The brigand turned and began walking away.

The knight stood, raised his arms over his head and stretched the mighty stretch of an active man who&apos;d spent the day doing puzzles cross-legged on the ground.  He leaned left and right, pulled his arms in front of his torso and behind, stood tip-toed on each leg in turn, and only then, fully limber, did he chance to turn around and see, for the first time in hours, his lord&apos;s castle.

And the hastily-assembled log bridge that the brigand&apos;s compatriots had levered across the moat while he was distracted.

And the ladder they had climbed over the castle wall.

And his lord&apos;s corpse, hanging out the tower window, dripping blood on the parapet below.

Once upon a time there was a knight.

He was of no service.

He had had no lord.

But he had learned a very important lesson: Never let your opponent dictate the arena of the conflict. </text></entry>

&lt;li&gt;Like, &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I mean, like, Aerosmith sees Noivad and they&apos;re all like &lt;i&gt;wow, I want to be like that guy!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hear one time he rocked so hard it actually broke the space time continuum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all would&apos;ve been in big trouble if Noivad hadn&apos;t been there to fix it right away.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boy does that guy rock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All other changes this version are secret.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlike Noivad rocking, which is totally well-known.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open secret, my friends!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes indeed!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iClan is a tool to show you who&apos;s playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deltatao.com/clanlord/&quot;&gt;Clan Lord&lt;/a&gt;, the charming 2D persistent-world online roleplaying game that you really should be playing already.  You can use iClan to get a quick peek at who&apos;s clanning, or leave it running in the background to be notified when your friends sign on or when there&apos;s a suitable group playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iClan runs off of the same system that powers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deltatao.com/clanlord/status/&quot;&gt;the Clan Lord Informer&lt;/a&gt; web site.  Any and all credit for this niftily clever and cleverly nifty system goes to Rieger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iClan is compatible with any Mac running Mac OS X 10.3 or newer, including 10.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://homepage.mac.com/skerwin/files/iclan_1_2_2.zip&quot;&gt;Download iClan 1.2.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
