## Orthography

There are 29 triangle forms.  Two of these appear to be punctuation:

- `.` is akin to a period, ending a sentence.
- `,` is a separator used to disambiguate phrases.  The rules by which modifiers attach to nouns and by which verbs consume nouns are subtle; sometimes `,` is used to clarify the associations for legibility, and sometimes it's used to override the default conventions.

The remaining 27 triangles represent letters:

> `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+`

Alternating triangles are rotated such that the messages condense and interlock, but there doesn't seem to be any significance to this rotation -- it is purely orthographic.

Despite difference in orthography, both of these messages means the same thing:

- `ky fananmy promot+wtab`
- `ky  fananmy promot+wtab`

## Sentence Structure

The structure of a clause is:

> noun [noun modifiers...] [noun [noun modifiers...]...] verb [adverb]

A clause alone is a valid sentence, or two clauses may be joined together with a conjunction.  Conjunctions are marked by the letters `vai`.  We have no examples of multiple conjunctions in the same sentence, and it isn't clear what the associativity would be in that situation.

### Subordinate Clauses

There is at least one instance of a subordinate clause:

> noun noun noun verb verb

In that case the grammar is not entirely clear, but it appears that the innermost verb binds to the closest nouns as needed and that this verbal phrase then acts as a noun for resolving the outer verb, e.g.:

> noun (noun noun verb) verb

## Nouns

Every noun appears with a suffix specifying its declension:

- `ky` means 'subject'
- `my` means 'direct object'
- `vy` means 'secondary object' or 'subject of a subordinate clause'

Any of these can add a `d` to mark a plural.

Nouns may be followed by additional words that modify them:
- Words ending in `zyn` are adjectives and attach to the preceeding noun
- The word `pas` means 'the' and attaches to the preceeding noun
- Words ending in `if` are possessives and indicate the `if` word owns the leading noun -- "word sentenceif" would be "word of sentence".
- Words ending in `rm` are prepositions and refer to the preceeding noun

## Verbs

All verbs are inflected with a four-character suffixes specifying the mood, aspect, and tense.

> verb-?`t`??

The first character specifies the mood:

- `o` is the subjunctive
- `q` is the indicative
- `w` is the imperative

The second character is always `t` in all messages thus recovered.

The third character specifies the aspect:

- `a` is the perfect (a concrete beginning and ending)
- `d` is the imperfect (ongoing)

The final character specifies the tense:

- `d` is the past
- `b` is the future

There is probably a symbol for specifying the present tense, but thus far it hasn't been seen.

There does not seem to be any concept of subject/verb agreement for person, number, or gender, unless the static `t` is indicative of the third person.

## Vocabulary

Some of the following vocabulary is 'high confidence'; there are sculptures in the eastern mountains that illustrate the words, almost as though the creators were leaving us a primer.

- `oao` -- light
- `tzr` -- org
- `tli` -- material plane
- `m+tz` -- sun
- `tian` -- mirror
- `qui` -- time
- `axa` -- greymyr
- `maht` -- fear
- `mapr` -- break
- `tlaic` -- war
- `mih` -- death

Based on phonetics, we've concluded that the if `tzr` sounds like 'org', then it's likely that `tzrt` is 'orga'.

The following words have been painstakingly deduced from the triangular messages; in most cases we're quite certain that the meaning is directionally correct, even if the translation is imprecise:

- `lama` -- priest
- `yet+` -- beginning
- `yet` -- middle
- `pi+c+` -- piece
- `jrin` -- join
- `caus+` -- cause
- `us+` -- use
- `strp` -- stop
- `b+` -- be
- `lik+` -- like

One of the most frequent words in the trianglular messages is the word `erd`; structurally the word appears to be singular, suggesting it refers to an individual rather than a group, though it's also possible it's a pronoun ('us') and that pronouns or some collective nouns follow different rules.

Comparing the phonetics to `tzr` (org) has led some PSA members to hypothesize that it may be pronounced 'tgeau', which may suggest some connection to the mythological 'Josephus the Ancient'.  For the sake of clarity the document below translates `erd` as 'Joe'.

## Order

There appears to be no indication of a 'correct' order for reading the triangle messages, nor is there any clear indication that they are connected in a narrative structure.   Each 'set' of messages appears to be topically connected, however.  No effort has been made to reorder the following translations.
