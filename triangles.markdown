## Grammar

Translations below are built on the following assumptions.

- Verbs bind to the nearest preceeding nouns.
- `pas` (pas) means 'always' or 'every' and prefers to bind to the following word, unless followed by a comma, in which case it binds left.
- `trrm` (trrm) is a generalized possessive pronoun (his/her/its/their) that binds to the preceeding word.
- Possessives &mdash; ending in `if` (-if) &mdash; bind to the preceeding noun.

## Literal Translation

The manual translations below (in a script font) take some liberties with the text, trying to make the meaning clearer.  This is obviously error-prone.

Some words in the triangle lexicon seem to have meanings that don't translate simply.

For instance, the examples below translate `qui` as 'time', but it seems to more precisely mean 'the forward passage of time' or perhaps more generally 'movement in the direction of increased entropy'.

Similarly, we 'know' that `xioao` can mean 'an extinguished candle' or 'the extinguishing of a candle', but the examples below frequently translate it as 'death' because that seems to make more contextual sense.

## Guessing

Some of the words below are total guesses based on what contextually seems to make sense.  The most prominent guesses are:

 - `caus+` (caus+) &mdash; command
 - `us+` (us+) &mdash; implore
 - `strp` (strp) &mdash; cease
 - `b+` (b) &mdash; become
 - `lik+` (lik+) &mdash; love
 - `tlaic` (tlaic) &mdash; war

At least some of the verb tenses seem to be slightly 'off', though there is a possibility that the author of the message erred grammatically once or twice.

## Errors (OOC)

There are some cases where the translation rubric doesn't make grammatical sense, but *does* make sense if we assume that the authors are English speakers who occassionally make mistakes.  Specifically I think there are spots where the subjunctive was incorrectly used only because in English the word is identical to a different tense.

I don't want to lean to heavily on this explanation, but it does allow some degree of handwaving.

## Experimenting

Expand the sections below to modify or replace the vocabulary list and see the results.

All prefixes will be tried repeatedly until no matches are found; then all suffixes will be processed the same way; finally the remaining word will be matched (exactly) against the 'words' list.

The code is somewhat primitive and can easily get confused.  Try to put longer prefixes/suffixes first in the list.  

The suggested translations (script font) can't be modified from what's coded into the page.
