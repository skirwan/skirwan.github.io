## Justification

Starting point: `m#tzlama` ('m+tzlama') appears to identify a person.  Possibly by name ('Mzlama'), possibly as a title â€” the `lama` (guru?) of the `m+tz`(sun).  Either way, `m+tzlama` is most likely a noun.

Since `m+tzlamakyd` appears in the text, we infer that `kyd` ('kyd') is a noun declension.

The appearances of `m+tzlamakyd` are each followed by `erdif` ('erdif'), twice with a comma that suggests the two words form a complete phrase.  From this we infer that `erdif` is a verb.  As `erd` frequently appears with different suffixes, we infer that `erd` is the root verb, and that `if`, `ky`, and `my` ('if', 'ky', 'my') are likely verb conjugations.

Treating those as conjugations helps us identify other words that are likely to be verbs, and suggests that `vy` ('vy') is likely another conjugation.

The parallel structure here (ending in 'y') suggests similarity.  The exception - `if` ('if') - may be telling; my current theory is that it indicates the infinitive.

## Experimenting

Expand the sections below to modify or replace the vocabulary list and see the results.

All prefixes will be tried repeatedly until no matches are found; then all suffixes will be processed the same way; finally the remaining word will be matched (exactly) against the 'words' list.

The code is somewhat primitive and can easily get confused.  Try to put longer prefixes/suffixes first in the list.  

The suggested translations (script font) can't be modified from what's coded into the page.
