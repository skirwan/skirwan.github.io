## Orthography

There are 29 triangle forms.  Two of these appear to be punctuation:

- `.` is akin to a period, ending a sentence.
- `,` is a separator used to disambiguate phrases.  The rules by which modifiers attach to nouns and by which verbs consume nouns are subtle; sometimes `,` is used to clarify the associations for legibility, and sometimes it's used to override the default conventions.

The remaining 27 triangles represent letters:

> `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+`

Alternating triangles are rotated such that the messages condense and interlock, but there doesn't seem to be any significance to this rotation -- it is purely orthographic.

Despite difference in orthography, both of these messages means the same thing:

- `ky fananmy promot+wtab`
- `ky  fananmy promot+wtab`

## Sentence Structure

The structure of a clause is:

> noun [modifiers...] [noun [modifiers...]...] verb [adverb]

A clause alone is a valid sentence, or two clauses may be joined together with a conjunction.  Conjunctions are marked by the letters `vai`.  We have no examples of multiple conjunctions in the same sentence, and it isn't clear what the associativity would be in that situation.

### Subordinate Clauses

There is at least one instance of a subordinate clause:

> noun noun noun verb verb

In that case the grammar is not entirely clear, but it appears that the innermost verb binds to the closest nouns as needed and that this verbal phrase then acts as a noun for resolving the outer verb, e.g.:

> noun (noun noun verb) verb

## Nouns

Every noun appears with a suffix specifying its declension:

- `ky` means 'subject'
- `my` means 'direct object'
- `vy` means 'secondary object' or 'subject of a subordinate clause'

Any of these can add a `d` to mark a plural.

Nouns may be followed by additional words that modify them:
- Words ending in `zyn` are adjectives and attach to the preceeding noun
- The word `pas` means 'the' and attaches to the preceeding noun
- Words ending in `if` are possessives and indicate the `if` word owns the leading noun -- "word sentence`if`" would be "word of sentence".
- Words ending in `rm` are prepositions and refer to the preceeding noun

## Pronouns

Occassionally a noun declension appears indepently of a noun.  At present we are treating these as pronouns.

## Verbs

All verbs are conjugated with a four-character suffixes.

> verb-?`t`??

Though we're very confident that these suffixes indicate a verb, the conjugations are relatively low-confidence.

In general we believe the first two characters indicate the mood:

- `qt` seems to be the simple indicative
- `wt` appears to be imperative
- `ot` seems to indicate the start or onset of a state
- `st` may indicate a planned/intentional future tense

The remaining two characters are also unclear:

- `dd` seems to mean 'plural' (relatively high confidence)
- `ad` may mean 'collective noun', when the subject is declined as a singular but indicates a group
- `db` may be the simple singular


## Vocabulary

Some of the following vocabulary is 'high confidence'; there are sculptures in the eastern mountains that illustrate the words, almost as though the creators were leaving us a primer.

- `oao` -- light
- `tzr` -- org
- `tli` -- material plane
- `m+tz` -- sun
- `tian` -- gate
- `qui` -- time
- `axa` -- greymyr
- `maht` -- fear
- `mapr` -- break
- `tlaic` -- war
- `mih` -- death

Based on phonetics, we've concluded that the if `tzr` sounds like 'org', then it's likely that `tzrt` is 'orga'.

The following words have been painstakingly deduced from the triangular messages; in most cases we're quite certain that the meaning is directionally correct, even if the translation is imprecise:

- `lama` -- priest
- `yet+` -- beginning
- `yet` -- middle
- `pi+c+` -- piece
- `jrin` -- join
- `caus+` -- cause
- `us+` -- use
- `strp` -- stop
- `b+` -- be
- `lik+` -- like

One of the most frequent words in the trianglular messages is `erd`.  Conversations with surviving Ancients have
confirmed that it refers to their people.  It is translated as 'us' below, but it isn't clear whether the word is a
pronoun or the name for the Ancient civilization.  Additionally, it is declined as a singular, but contextually plural.
This is the primary reason for suspecting the `ad` verb suffix indicates a collective noun.
