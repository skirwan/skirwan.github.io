![](/assets/rover.gif)SDI/Phison wants to look at my hyperactive Rover (which, come to think of it, I haven't mentioned yet), so I got a replacement. This one's held together by itself instead of by Scotch tape, so I guess it's an upgrade. I can't wait to get a production unit with final plastics. And a Rover t-shirt. In fact, I almost want the t-shirt more. That dog is _so fricking cute_! It's like puppies and kittens fighting over beanie babies.
