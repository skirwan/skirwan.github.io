Major Owens (and how's _that_ for a first name!) [wants you to know](http://www.cnsnews.com//ViewNation.asp?Page=\\Nation\\archive\\200409\\NAT20040902a.html) that Bush is leading this country "into a snake pit of fascism", down a path reminiscent of "Nazi Germany". Obviously nobody ever told the man about [Godwin's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law).
