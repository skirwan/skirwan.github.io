<p>Major Owens (and how's <i>that</i> for a first name!) <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com//ViewNation.asp?Page=\\Nation\\archive\\200409\\NAT20040902a.html">wants you to know</a> that Bush is leading this country "into a snake pit of fascism", down a path reminiscent of "Nazi Germany".  Obviously nobody ever told the man about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin's Law</a>.</p>
