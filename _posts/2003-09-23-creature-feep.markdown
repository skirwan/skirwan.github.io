Just when I'm moving up into number two in a basic google search (w00t!), they have to go and introduce the [geographically-limited google search](http://labs.google.com/location/index.html). Which is cool, no doubt, but it's another search engine that I'll need to convince of my supremity among Sean Kerwins. Unfortunately, it's not working properly at the moment (probably has something to do with [making the front page](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/23/1415235&mode=nested&tid=126&tid=95) of [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org)) so I can't see what it thinks of me. I suspect not much, however, as there's no explicit mention of my location anywhere on the site.

Which is too bad, 'cause it's really pretty nice down here in southwest Florida. Plenty sunny up here in Estero, but I suspect it may be raining down home in Naples.
