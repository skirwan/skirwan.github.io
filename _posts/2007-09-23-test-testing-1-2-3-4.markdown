I _think_ I just upgraded to Movable Type 4.1. The real test, of course, is whether you can read this.

'You' in this context being, of course, 'me'.  Because nobody actually reads this.

  

EDIT: Okay, one person reads this.  And I suppose I really ought to thank God for her, because otherwise I'd just be a computer geek talking to himself.  ;)
