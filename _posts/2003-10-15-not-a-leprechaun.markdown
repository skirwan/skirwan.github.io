<p>I am forced to the conclusion that <a href="http://quizilla.com">Quizilla</a> is far too insightful to be ignored.  I usually take these tests when they're not too long and seem somewhat interesting, but this is the first time the results have amused me quite this much.</p>
<p>The title of this post is, of course, an obscure Buffy reference.  I feel compelled to state this explicitly because I know of only one other person on Earth who would get the joke otherwise.</p>
<div class="leftfloating"><img src="http://images.quizilla.com/D/donarepa/1065683791_ampirequiz.JPG" alt="Vampire" /><br />Form 9, Vampire: The Undying</div>
<p><i>"And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to regrow life from the dead.  But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again."</i></p>
<p>Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian).  The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire.  Her sign is the eclipsed moon.</p>
<p>As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual.  You may be a little idealistic, but you are very grounded and down to earth.  You realize that not everything lasts, but you savor every minute of the good times.  While you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you have strong ties with people that will never be broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have because they are sensible.</p>
