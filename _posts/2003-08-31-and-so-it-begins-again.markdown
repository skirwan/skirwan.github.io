<p>I've tried this weblogging thing several times now.  Four?  </p>

<p>Maybe five.  Or three.  </p>

<p>Plenty, at any rate.</p>

<p>The point is, I'm lazy.  I think blogging is a <b>Nifty Idea</b> but I really don't have the discipline to do this on a regular basis.  But hope springs eternal.</p>
