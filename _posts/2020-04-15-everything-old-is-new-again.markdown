This blog was first created in 2003, run off of (as I recall) a PowerMac G4 in
my bedroom.  This was before 'the cloud', when it wasn't entirely absurd for
people to run websites off of spare computers in a closet.  It was originally
hosted using `DynDNS`[^1] at (I think) `hamstergeddon.dyndns.org` because I had
recently discovered [Invader Zim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invader_Zim) and
I thought the name was funny.[^2]

I chose to run on [Movable Type](https://www.movabletype.org) because it was
free, customizable, and easy enough for a relative UNIX-neophyte to get running
on Mac OS X.

At some point -- I think in 2006?  I got a real domain name (`seankerwin.org`)
and moved to a real hosting provider.  Time had moved forward quite a bit and
though (to my surprise and delight) Movable Type still existed, it had changed
considerably and my custom page design didn't translate well.  Ever since
'whenever that was' the site has been running on a fairly standard MT template
with only minimal modification.

 > Then the fire nation attacked.

Actually, I quit my job, moved to California, and started working at
[SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com).  Which proceeded to eat my free time like some
kind of chronovorous monster.

Eventually I -- *what's the polite term for 'burned the frack out'?*  And I went
from delivering stuff to orbit to
['maybe delivering stuff to Saudi Arabia someday?'](https://hyperloop-one.com)
and then to ['hey buddy wanna rent a scooter'](https://www.bird.co) and dear God
when you put it like that it really feels like a slow steady decline, doesn't
it?

Anyway then *the scooter thing* [took a turn for the worse](https://dot.la/bird-layoffs-meeting-story-2645612465.html)
and now suddenly here I am with enough time to work on my blog again, and now
we're all caught up except for the wife[^3] and the kittens and all the other
stuff.

Anyway:
- The [iClan](/iclan/) page is blank because iClan doesn't work on modern OS X
  and somebody else filled the void while I was MIA and I don't think the world
  needs iClan anymore.
- The [Stylunk](/stylunk/) page contains the web-based Stylunk that had been
  previously labeled 'beta' and is now the only version of Stylunk you'll find
  on this site.
    - The only thing I touched on web-Stlyunk were the styles -- I hit them very
      hard with a rock to make them fit into the new page layout.  There are
      probably bugs.
    - I haven't updated any of the code since I first posted it 8+ years ago,
      and in hindsight it's a horrifying mess.  At some point I may rewrite it,
      because I suspect in TypeScript and React it would be a depressingly short
      program.
    - If there are new clothing colors in Clan Lord since I went AWOL, you are
      free to submit a Pull Request, because...
- The new site is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) at
  [https://github.com/skirwan/skirwan.github.io](https://github.com/skirwan/skirwan.github.io)
    - It's built on Jekyll and hosted through GitHub Pages.

I have like three different folders full of 'blog post ideas' that I've been
saving for the past eight years; hopefully I'll get some of them published
before I end up employed again[^4].

    Circle of life, right?  You're good, you're popular, you're bought by
    Oracle, time passes... I'm surprised you still exist and how expensive you
    are.

[^2]:
    That this statement is in the past tense should not be interpreted to
    imply that I do not presently find the name 'Hamstergeddon' hilarious.

[^3]:
    My two favorite things are 'putting serious and important things in a place
    where the reader has been led to expect unimportant information' and 'my
    lovely wife', and I'm sure she won't mind that I've done a little crossover
    episode here, right?

[^4]:
    This statement is made in jest, but I am well aware that I'm very privileged
    to be able to say this jokingly.
