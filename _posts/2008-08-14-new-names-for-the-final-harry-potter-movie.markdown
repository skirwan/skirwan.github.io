Now that they've [shifted the release schedule back](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/harry-potter-half-blood-prince-moves/story.aspx?guid=%7BF4F52B7F-D1B1-4DC0-BF8A-AD0D9252BE7A%7D&dist=hppr) even further, I think they're going to need some new titles for the movies.

  

*   Harry Potter and the Rascal Mobility Scooter
*   Harry Potter and the Mystery of the Kids Blasting Their New-Fangled Rock and Roll Music
*   Harry Potter and the Lawn You Damned Kids Better Get Off Of
*   Harry Potter and the Colonscopy of Terror
*   Harry Potter and the Bottle of Lipitor
*   Harry Potter and the Order of the AARP
*   Harry Potter and the Cauldron of Prunes

  

Half of those are Hoggle's fault. Â In fact, I'm going to blame them all on him.
