<p>You want news?  <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0628041moore1.html">This</a> is news.  Executive summary: Michael Moore, notorious extremist-liberal-idiot-heart-attack-in-the-making, is <i>not</i>, as he has claimed, registered as an Independant.  He is in fact registered as a Democrat in New York.  Which is fine; as Moore innacuracies go, this one is minor.  Except for the fact that he's also registered in Michigan.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm sure it's probably a mistake.  But it's interesting to think about this; if a prominent conservative were stuffing the ballot box the news networks would be all over it (Hell, Rush Limbaugh can't even .  But this hasn't shown up anywhere but <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/">The Smoking Gun</a>.  And if, hypothetically, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/">Fox News</a> were to run a segment about this, they would take still more undeserved flak about being Republican shills.</p>
