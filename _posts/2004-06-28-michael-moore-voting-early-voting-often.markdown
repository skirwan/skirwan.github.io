You want news? [This](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0628041moore1.html) is news. Executive summary: Michael Moore, notorious extremist-liberal-idiot-heart-attack-in-the-making, is _not_, as he has claimed, registered as an Independant. He is in fact registered as a Democrat in New York. Which is fine; as Moore innacuracies go, this one is minor. Except for the fact that he's also registered in Michigan.

Yeah, I'm sure it's probably a mistake. But it's interesting to think about this; if a prominent conservative were stuffing the ballot box the news networks would be all over it (Hell, Rush Limbaugh can't even . But this hasn't shown up anywhere but [The Smoking Gun](http://thesmokinggun.com/). And if, hypothetically, [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/) were to run a segment about this, they would take still more undeserved flak about being Republican shills.
