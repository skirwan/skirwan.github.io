<p>Two more themes.  One is minimalistic and is my response to comments about the tulip theme being too complicated, while the other is frivolous and amuses me greatly.</p>

<p>The second would be a lot more accurate if there were some mechanism in CSS to reorder elements - you'll notice I've put the date headers on the title bars for each post, but any long-time slashdotter will know that's not right.  Hopefully there'll be something like this in CSS4...?</p>

<p>It seems like it should be possible; within and XML structure of a blog it would make sense for any attribute of a post (date, poster, title, body) to appear in any order - and if I remember my XML correctly, there's really no way for a schema to enforce any particular (preferred?) ordering.  Here's hoping something like this shows up someday.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most everything appears to break under IE5/Win, and most of my stylesheets are subtly wrong in IE5/Mac.  And I have no info on IE6/Win anymore.</p>

<p>Ah well.</p>
