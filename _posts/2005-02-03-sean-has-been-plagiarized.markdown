At one point, quite a long time ago in Internet time, (2002) I posted to Slashdot. The topic is unimportant, but it was in response to a long, rambling, incoherent post and I think it did a fairly decent job of ripping the dweeb a new one. [Check it out](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=28984&cid=3113144).

Anyway, not too long afterwards I discovered someone named Martin had adopted my quote as part of his signature, and even included a link to the original comment. I was honored, of course, that a random stranger had found me worth quoting. You can still find a couple ([1](http://www.cctec.com/maillists/nanog/historical/0211/msg00052.html),[2](http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/2002-03/msg00212.html)) of Martin's messages cached on the web.

But now someone has taken my creative product and used it without proper attribution. Witness [some random quote page](http://www.expander.net/quotes.php), and [some random random page](http://www.screamingmonk.com/spudtarget.cfm) (the quote in the masthead rotates, but trust me, it's there).

On the one hand, I guess it's a compliment. On the other hand, my ambitions towards supervillainy would seem to demand a swift and prejudicial reprisal. What say you, six regular but largely-nonparcipitory and partially-anonymous readers?
