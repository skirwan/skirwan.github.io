<p>At one point, quite a long time ago in Internet time, (2002) I posted to Slashdot.  The topic is unimportant, but it was in response to a long, rambling, incoherent post and I think it did a fairly decent job of ripping the dweeb a new one. <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=28984&cid=3113144">Check it out</a>.</p>

<div class="quote"><blockquote><i>If Morpheus can use the Gnutella network together with all their aparatus of media file meta-information, and multiple segmented downloading, and if they use the hyper-cube network approach, rather than the tree one, it will simply rocks, and no one will be able to stop it when it begins.</i></blockquote>And if pigs can fly, and I can ride one, and they fly me to hell, and it just froze over, and we all have ice cream...</div>

<p>Anyway, not too long afterwards I discovered someone named Martin had adopted my quote as part of his signature, and even included a link to the original comment.  I was honored, of course, that a random stranger had found me worth quoting.  You can still find a couple (<a href="http://www.cctec.com/maillists/nanog/historical/0211/msg00052.html">1</a>,<a href="http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/2002-03/msg00212.html">2</a>) of Martin's messages cached on the web.</p>

<p>But now someone has taken my creative product and used it without proper attribution.  Witness <a href="http://www.expander.net/quotes.php">some random quote page</a>, and <a href="http://www.screamingmonk.com/spudtarget.cfm">some random random page</a> (the quote in the masthead rotates, but trust me, it's there).</p>

<p>On the one hand, I guess it's a compliment.  On the other hand, my ambitions towards supervillainy would seem to demand a swift and prejudicial reprisal.  What say you, six regular but largely-nonparcipitory and partially-anonymous readers?</p>
