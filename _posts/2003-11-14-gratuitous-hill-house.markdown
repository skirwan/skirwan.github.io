<p>Still more CSS tweaking - now I can easily quote text and code, and it really looks quite pretty:</p><div class="quote">"No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone."</div><p>Pretty nice, eh?  I'm proud of it.</p><p>Anyhoo... I think that bit about reality is dead on.  I need to find some creative outlets before my head explodes... burying myself in the mythos of the Dark Tower helps, but it's really not a long-term solution.</p>
