<p>It's not supposed to be cold in Florida.  It's supposed to be warm and sunny, with cloud-free skies and a bright outlook.  I shouldn't need to bundle up just to sit at my computer with the fan off and the window shut.  This is <i>not</i> right!</p>

<p>SNL is funny again this week.  I wonder if there's some kind of a complex numeric pattern governing that, like how the Star Trek movies used to be.</p>

<p>Stupid 'Nemesis', killing off a good pattern.  Grr.</p>
