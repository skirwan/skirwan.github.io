<p>Just played some CSS games.  Current site status:</p>

<ul><li>Readable with Safari, Mozilla, IE5 Mac</li><li>Unreadable in IE6 Win (content area underlaps sidebar)</li><li>Dark sigil appears on Safari, Mozilla, IE6 Win</li><li>Light sigil appears on Safari, Mozilla, IE5 Mac, IE6 Win</li></ul>

<p>So I've got things working perfectly in Safari and Mozilla, nearly perfectly in IE5 Mac, and horribly in IE6 Win.  Ironically, the change that fixed IE5 Mac is what broke IE6 Win.</p>

<p>I'm getting really sick of Microsoft.</p>

<p>Sad note: Apparently Safari won't animate background GIFs.  I can understand the decision, but it's still disappointing.  Switch temporarily to another browser if you want to marvel at the splendour of my flickering Christmas lights.  Or I guess you could just <a href="http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/images/title-xmas.gif">view them directly</a>.  They look better in context, though.</p>

<p>So at the moment, only Mozilla is rendering everything correctly.  Rah-rah open source, I suppose.</p>
