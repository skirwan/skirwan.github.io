I'm a senior web software developer now.  I'm not really clear about to whom or what I'm senior, but beggars can't look a gift horse in the choice, right?

At least I'm not a señor developer.  My Spanish is atrocious.  Or rather, it would be atrocious if I knew any Spanish beyond yo quiero Taco Bell.  And for the record, I neither know any Spanish nor quiero any Taco Bell.
