<p>IE 6 seems to render my newly-widened calendar as a full-page-width block beneath both columns.  I can't think of any good reason why, excpet that Microsoft is retarded.  Add it to the to-do list, I guess.</p>

<p>Luckily, the new-new positioning of the new Ixian logo seems to show up correctly here.  Yay?</p>
