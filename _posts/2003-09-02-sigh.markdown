Well, here's something I can do in this bloody 'intro to computers' course. I can write seditious comments on my blog. Nifty.

I swear to God, this guy has never actually heard English spoken aloud. Grr.

On the upside, the stupid-touchy-feely-hippy class might be fun if I play things right... the teacher seems willing to beleive that my argumentativeness, cynicism, and sarcasm represent a legitimate and unwilling effort to play the Devil's advocate. I think.

Not an easy woman to read, come to think of it. I'm going to call that a compliment.
