One of the hallmarks of Joss Whedon's shows has been the consistently witty dialog. Obviously the man is just as capable of wit off the air:

> "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the road less traveled by and they CANCELLED MY FRIKKIN' SHOW. I totally shoulda took the road that had all those people on it. Damn."  

Yup, despite an ever-broadening demographic and a 37% rise in ratings, _Angel_ has been shuffled to the ever popular 'never' timeslot.

Anyway, this puts me in a quandry - do I want a new Buffiverse spinoff? On the one hand, I want to know what happens to all these characters, and this world. On the other hand, if you kept adding series to the franchise sooner or later you'd end up with Xander marooned in the Delta Quadrant fighting off Borg. And that'd be bad.

It really pisses me off when networks do this. The network was gushing about how nice they were to announce this so early, but that's total bull; at this point much of the season has been shot, and I'm sure nearly all of it has been written or at least planned. There's no way to wrap up all the loose threads in the remaining time, because some of them would need at least a full season to resolve fairly.

If the network cared about the happiness of the viewers - or rather, the satisfaction of their customers - they'd announce now that _next_ season would be the last. That'd give Whedon and company time to cobble together some kind of passable finale.

Ah well. For those keep score, the only good show left on the WB network is _Smallville_. But we _Angel_ fans can still tune in to _Charmed_! Yeah, _Charmed_! It's just like _Angel_, in that it never would have happened without _Buffy_, but it's much faster-paced because they decided to forego plot entirely, electing instead to just put Alyssa Milano in a new costume every week. Yeah, _Charmed_!
