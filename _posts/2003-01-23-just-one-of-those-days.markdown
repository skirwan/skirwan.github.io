<p>Well, the new layout looks nice-ish in Win IE 6.  I think that about covers everything, except of course Opera and iCab.  I think it's okay for me to arbitrarily decide that I don't much like people who use Opera or iCab though, so I'm not going to worry about it.</p>

<p>I've got enough to worry about today.</p>

<p>I have sitting on my desk a second generation Universal Media Reader, exhibiting a bug that was supposed to be fixed in the second generation.  This is of course after finding out a few days back that every single one of the second generation units had a new and exciting bug.  This product will be the death of me.</p>

<p>Random thought for the day: why do I bother?  I've always believed that everything in life is an exercise in optimization, and that it's simply a matter of making sure what you're optimizing.  I used to think I was ahead of the game, because I was optimizing happiness while others were optimizing money.  I wonder if I'm doing that anymore.  I'm certainly not jumping-up-and-down happy living in intelligent storage land, but then I wasn't happy doing nothing either.  I guess I need to either adjust my world view or figure out under what circumstance I would be happy.</p>

<p>I guess that wasn't very random, was it?</p>

<p>Slightly more random thought for the day: Why the hell would anybody use a TiVo to watch the Super Bowl?  The commercials are at least half the fun!</p>
