I honestly can't understand anything this guy says. The problem isn't really the accent; I have sufficient experience with oriental accents to do okay with that. The problem is that he pronounces words incorrectly in such a way that he's actually saying another unrelated word perfectly. So, I present to me the _Intro to Computers_ to _English_ dictionary:

_When he says \[...\], he really means \[...\]_

<table><tbody><tr><td>Stair</td><td>Style</td></tr><tr><td>Future</td><td>Feature</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>File</td></tr><tr><td>Member</td><td>Number</td></tr><tr><td>Test</td><td>Text</td></tr><tr><td>Text</td><td>Test</td></tr><tr><td>Chins</td><td>Change</td></tr><tr><td>Multiply</td><td>Modify</td></tr><tr><td>Pounds</td><td>Points</td></tr><tr><td>Scene</td><td>Thing</td></tr><tr><td>Lan</td><td>Line</td></tr><tr><td>Supply</td><td>The Apply [Button]</td></tr><tr><td>Wary</td><td>Very</td></tr></tbody></table>
