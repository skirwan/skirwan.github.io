For anyone who cares, the 'correct' username and password for the [Underscore Hosting site](http://www.underscorehosting.com) are `islp4142` and `f9dds33`, respectively.

Unfortunately this information is entirely useless, as my IP isn't acceptable.

New working theory: doing some portscans, it appears that some of these sites have telnet/ssh enabled. Perhaps with appropriate credentials, such as those of the elusive [Beth](http://www.metadex.net/usr/emc2/bio/), we might obtain shell access to a machine that _does_ have an acceptable IP, and might then use telnet or lynx from there to retrieve useful information?

I'm wondering if there actually is a puzzle here. It seems inconceivable that someone would dig a rabbit hole quite this deep...
