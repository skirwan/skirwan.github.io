<p>First off: I despise my roommate.  He's an ill-mannered drunken slob, and if he dropped dead of a wasting disease I doubt I'd shed a tear.</p>

<p>I was back home this weekend, working on something that necessitates being on the far side of the fascist uber-firewall that this so-called school has inflicted on me, and during my abscence the apartment was, to engage in a rather heinous act of understatement, trashed.  Apparently there was quite a bit of <i>partying</i> going on this weekend.</p>

<p>I say '<i>partying</i>' rather than the more simple 'partying' because in this context '<i>partying</i>' means <i>unwanted drunken goings-on</i> rather than the more traditional definition concerning the particple form of enjoyable festivities.</p>

<p>Anyway, apparently our resident whomever (R.A.? R.M.?  Something...) had words with HellRoommate.  I had a brief discussion with The Man today, and it was made quite clear in a distinctly subtextual fashion that well-phrased testimony could start us all down the path to removing the unwanted element.</p>

<p>Sounds great, right?</p>

<p>Thing is, I'd feel guilty.  There's no rational reason for guilt; he clearly has it ('it' meaning eviction and several other inconveniently complex forms of karma) coming.  He's not the sort of... 'individual'... for whom I should feel compassion.</p>

<p>It must be nice to be evil.  Lex Luthor would've had this bum out of here months ago.  Sigh.</p>
