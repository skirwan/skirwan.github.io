<p>During the day I don’t get a lot of time to keep up with the news.  My sole source for tales from the outside world is a television in a glass-walled conference room — I pass the room frequently, and as I pass I’m able to catch a momentary glimpse of either CNN or MSNBC.</p>

<p>You would think, from the headlines displayed on those stations, that the only event of note in the past week was the arrest of a man who may have murdered a little girl ten years ago (but is more likely just a kook, if the forensics mean anything at all).  I don’t mean to make light of the suffering of a child, but I think most reasonable people would agree that this story wasn’t even national news back when it was new.</p>

<p>Catching the headlines on CNN, you wouldn’t even realize there’s a war on in Lebanon, that the UN has ‘forced’ a ceasefire, and that a crapload of <i>French</i> troops are being sent in to <s>act as human shields</s> keep the peace <s>while Hezbollah reloads</s> while the situation cools down.</p>

<p>Catching the headlines on CNN, you wouldn’t even know that the news of this war coming out of Beirut is based at least in part on <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=21956_Reuters_Doctoring_Photos_from_Beirut&only">doctored photographs</a>.  Nor would you know that many of the images and videos showing ‘victims of the attacks’ are in fact <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=22123_Green_Helmet_Admits_Staging_Photos&only">staged by Hezbollah sympathizers</a> who carry corpses around and artfully arrange them to produce the most ‘convincing’ imagery possible.</p>

<p>Catching the headlines on CNN, you wouldn’t even know that the Democratic party has become so <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/">mindless and morally bankrupt</a> that one of the few liberals who isn’t actively working to destroy America is <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/007765.php">forced to run as an independent</a>.</p>

<p>You probably <i>would</i> know that the NSA wiretapping program has been <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/18/WIRETAP.TMP">ruled unconstitutional</a> (after all, it’s a defeat for Bush, right?), but you might not have heard that <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/015041.php">more</a> <a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2006_08_13-2006_08_19.shtml#1155837741">than</a> <a href="http://irishspy.typepad.com/public_secrets/2006/08/the_dark_legacy.html">one</a> <a href="http://jacklewis.net/weblog/archives/2006/08/judge_that_rule.php">person</a> agrees the opinion is full of shit.</p>

<p>So I’m glad we’ve got the Internet thing, ‘cause without it who <i>knows</i> what we’d know.</p>
