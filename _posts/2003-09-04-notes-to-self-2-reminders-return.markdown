The left margin or padding of the main content block isn't displaying correctly in IE 6. Also, the MT icon/link is displaying with a brightly-colored box around it. I think Mozilla did the same thing, come to think of it.

Apparently MT isn't smart enough to close HTML tags that are open at the end of a post. I left the slash out of an italics-closing tag, and ended up with the rest of the page slanting to the right. Which is find for me, 'cause I'm kinda conservative, but not really the effect I was going for.

I suppose if I were a good open-source consumer I'd go looking for the appropriate section of MT code and add a patch to ensure that all entries close all their tags. Maybe if I'm exceptionally bored. And I beat Splinter Cell. Err, _Tom Clancy's_ Splinter Cell. Friggin' egomaniac.
