<p>Random thought for the night:  Tetris is NP-complete, and thus difficult for a computer to solve.  Tetris is also fairly easy for quite a few humans.  Stay with me, here.  If you have a convenient algorithm for solving an NP-complete problem, it's trivial (for folks who know how) to convert this algorithm to solve any NP-complete problem.  Right?</p>

<p>I have this image of a room full of kids, sitting at terminals, playing Tetris, unaware that the game they're playing is a translation of another NP-complete process entirely.  Think of the game room from Ender's game, but they're all actually playing Tetris, never knowing that they're winning a galactic war or whatever.</p>

<p>This is either really cool or really dumb.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>Sean sleeps now.</p>
