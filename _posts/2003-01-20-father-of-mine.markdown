<p>So I'm sitting at my desk, scribbling randomly on my pad.  Suddenly, I stop, look down at what I've written, and gasp.</p>

<p>Shocking.</p>

<p>It's not what I've written; it's how I've written it.  I'm looking down at a perfect replica of Dad's handwriting.</p>

<p>As if it weren't bad enough that I sound like him on the phone.</p>

<p>Luckily, further experimentation seems to indicate it may be a fluke; I'm unable to consciously emulate his penmanship.  It seems to be something that I'm only able to do when I'm not fully paying attention</p>

<p>In the world of intelligent storage devices, a new unholy alliance has taken form; this time it's Engineering and Tech Support, rather than QA and Marketing.  Still rather unholy, though.</p>
