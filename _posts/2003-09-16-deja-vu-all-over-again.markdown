<p>He's an idiot.</p>

<p>I thought at first that he might be a reasonably intelligent person with a minimal understanding of English and a rather crappy job, but no.</p>

<p>Anybody who can argue with a straight face that there's a functional difference between setting a first line indent and just hitting tab in Word really doesn't know what he's talking about.  "Well on my compiler [computer?] it is always us [obvious?] that there are difference between fist [first] LAN [line] indent and the tab.  The tab can have a different with [width] on a different compiler [computer]."  Obviously he doesn't understand that the tab 'with' is stored in the 'fire'.  Jesus Christ.</p>
