It's going to take me at least a week to fully digest _Adaptation_. There's just that much to it. It may turn out in a week that I hate it, but early returns have it showing as the best film I've ever seen.

It's rare for me to see a movie and identify with a character; I'm just odd that way. I usually end up feeling for the villain, which I guess lends some credence to the opinion the rest of humanity has of me.

But _Adaptation_ was different; I don't identify with Cage's character, I _am_ Cage's character. I'm also the brother, and LaRoche, and the woman writer. It's a heady experience, being the entire cast. But it leaves the same difficult question I always end up with: does anybody else see this the same way I do? Do other folks love it for completely orthoganol reason, because they look at the characters and say, "hey, I know a loser just like that guy!"... I wish I could just pick something and beleive it.

Still. _You are what you love, not what loves you._ It's hard to believe; not hard in that the premise is difficult to understand or even unbelievable, but hard because it requires effort to believe it. Faith, I guess.

That's never been a strong point of mine. Which I guess ties nicely back into paragraph two, sentence two.
