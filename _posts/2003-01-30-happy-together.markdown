<p>It's going to take me at least a week to fully digest <i>Adaptation</i>.  There's just that much to it.  It may turn out in a week that I hate it, but early returns have it showing as the best film I've ever seen.</p>

<p>It's rare for me to see a movie and identify with a character; I'm just odd that way.  I usually end up feeling for the villain, which I guess lends some credence to the opinion the rest of humanity has of me.</p>

<p>But <i>Adaptation</i> was different; I don't identify with Cage's character, I <i>am</i> Cage's character.  I'm also the brother, and LaRoche, and the woman writer.  It's a heady experience, being the entire cast.  But it leaves the same difficult question I always end up with: does anybody else see this the same way I do?  Do other folks love it for completely orthoganol reason, because they look at the characters and say, "hey, I know a loser just like that guy!"...  I wish I could just pick something and beleive it.</p>

<p>Still.  <i>You are what you love, not what loves you.</i>  It's hard to believe; not hard in that the premise is difficult to understand or even unbelievable, but hard because it requires effort to believe it.  Faith, I guess.</p>

<p>That's never been a strong point of mine.  Which I guess ties nicely back into paragraph two, sentence two.</p>
