Every time I see 'ROTK' ([_The Return of the King_](http://www.lordoftherings.net/index_synopsis_rotk.html)) I misread it as 'ROTJ'.

Which gets me even more confused, because 'ROTJ' can be either [_Return of the Jedi_](http://www.starwars.com/episode-vi/) or [_Return of the Joker_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005Y71K/002-9729822-1193654?v=glance), depending on the context (mostly the first though).

This really has no bearing on anything, but as I find myself saying far too often, I hadn't said anything for a while.
