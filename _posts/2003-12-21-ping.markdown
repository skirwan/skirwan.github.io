<p>Every time I see 'ROTK' (<a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/index_synopsis_rotk.html"><i>The Return of the King</i></a>) I misread it as 'ROTJ'.</p>

<p>Which gets me even more confused, because 'ROTJ' can be either <a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-vi/"><i>Return of the Jedi</i></a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005Y71K/002-9729822-1193654?v=glance"><i>Return of the Joker</i></a>, depending on the context (mostly the first though).</p>

<p>This really has no bearing on anything, but as I find myself saying far too often, I hadn't said anything for a while.</p>
