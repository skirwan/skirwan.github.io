Sean is get-ting Zel-da!</p>
<p>Having successfully spent <i>way</i> too much money on Nintendo products, my inconspicuous consumption will shortly (~2 weeks) be rewarded with the greatest of all possible treasures: <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/zeldaclassic/">Zelda: Collector's Edition</a>.</p>

And Sean said, "I gots to get my Zelda on".  And Sean visited the site, and Sean entered the various codes.  And Sean saw that it was good.<br /><br />
Then Sean said, "come on, come one, come on!"  And Sean knew he must now play the waiting game.  And it was so.<br /><br />
And Sean did play the waiting game, and then Sean said, "oh, the waiting game sucks!"  And Sean did play Hungry Hungry Hippoes.  And Sean saw that it was good.<br /><br />
But then his email did Sean check, and there the confirmation message he did see.  And Sean said, "this is great!"  And it was so.<br /><br />
And-they-all-lived-happily-ever-after-the-end.
