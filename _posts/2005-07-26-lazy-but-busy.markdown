No updates for like fifty years. Luckily nobody reads this - the only reason the site exists is to maintain search-result supremacy for 'Sean Kerwin' and gain search-result supremacy for 'Skirwan' (as for 'SKerwin', I'll take it or leave it).

But all the same, if anyone out there plays Clan Lord, you should check out [Stylunk](http://dwarvenmilitia.com/Stylunk/), my Clan Lord clothes dye/bleach simulator, and [iClan](http://www.vagilemind.com/clanlord/viewtopic.php?t=1494), an application which ties in to HWC Rieger's [Clan Lord Informer](http://faircraft.com/clstatus/) system to alert you when your friends log on.
