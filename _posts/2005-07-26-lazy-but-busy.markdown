<p>No updates for like fifty years.  Luckily nobody reads this - the only reason the site exists is to maintain search-result supremacy for 'Sean Kerwin' and gain search-result supremacy for 'Skirwan' (as for 'SKerwin', I'll take it or leave it).</p>

<p>But all the same, if anyone out there plays Clan Lord, you should check out <a href="http://dwarvenmilitia.com/Stylunk/">Stylunk</a>, my Clan Lord clothes dye/bleach simulator, and <a href="http://www.vagilemind.com/clanlord/viewtopic.php?t=1494">iClan</a>, an application which ties in to HWC Rieger's <a href="http://faircraft.com/clstatus/">Clan Lord Informer</a> system to alert you when your friends log on.</p>
