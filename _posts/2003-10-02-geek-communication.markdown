<p>I use the term 'geek' as a general shorthand for technically-minded people, with the subtle hint at moderately lacking social skills.</p>

<p>I use the term 'geek' in reference to myself fairly regularly.</p>

<p>I've noticed that we, as a stereotype, have difficulties establishing communication.  Once you know that both parties are geeks (and that they are geekish in similar fields) they can transfer information at a truly remarkable pace.  But knowing this is never easy.</p>

<p>I understand how IP networking works.  Better than a great many professional sysadmins, I'd imagine.  But trying to convince another geekish human being that I'm able to handle these matters on my own is proving to be a bit of a sticking point.</p>

<p>Oh well.  I'll just use the standard Sean system.  Ignore everybody else, do it right, and hope they don't ask any questions.</p>

<p>Backup plan: If they ask questions, distract them with something brightly colored or shiny, and then run.</p>

<p>Backup backup plan: Two words... <a href="http://www.icecreamusa.com/klondike/">Klondike Bar</a>.  I'm not sure how this plan works, but I have a good feeling about it.</p>

<p>Mmmm.   Klondike Bar.</p>
