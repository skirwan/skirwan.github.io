There is another Mac user on my subnet. I'm reminded of him every night when I shut down my computer and iTunes notifies me that there's a user connected to my library.

I usually just click OK and go to bed.

Still, it strikes me what an incredibly odd technology Rendezvous has the potential to be. I have Rendezvous enabled in Safari, and nothing has come up as of yet. I'm half-tempted to turn on local access for iChat just to see if anyone else on the network has had the same thought.

But I'm probably not going to.
