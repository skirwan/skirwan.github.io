I read [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com) every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I check in for non-update posts occasionally in the time between. I know it's amazing that they're able to produce a comic on that schedule, but I also have a hard time appreciating the difficulty because, well, I can't draw. I _am_, however, able to write, and so the fact that they have a new news post three times a week is an achievement I'm able to appreciate in a slightly-fuller-but-still-not-full fashion.

Which is really a long-winded way of saying that I haven't posted in a few days.

If anybody besides [Her Highness](http://swcyella.blogspot.com) (and the three anonymous users I've noted in my logs) ever visited here I might even feel guilty. Instead I just feel lazy.

Something, I might add, to which I am fully accustomed.

Anyway.

[Simon and Garfunkel](http://www.simonandgarfunkel.com/) are probably the most rocking sexagenarians (it sounds dirty, but it's _not_) around. The immediate family went to a the recent concert in Sunrise (at the peculiarly-named [Office Depot Center](http://www.officedepotcenter.com/)) and I was quite impressed. The concert featured a 'surprise' appearance by [the Everly brothers](http://www.everly.net/), who are also remarkably well-preserved.

Really, the only disappointment is that they never played [_Kodachrome_](http://users.cis.net/sammy/kodacrm.htm), but I guess I really have no right to expect something from Simon's solo years to show up at a reunion tour. Ah well.

[CSN](http://www.seahawk.org/) reunion last night. As was the case during the time I actually _attended_ the school, I only recognized a fraction of those present. A fraction with a denominator rather significantly larger than its numerator, I must add. Noticed something odd today, though; with a single exception, all my friends from HS have four-letter appellations available (I say _available_ because C\_ was originally introduced to me under quadra-charactered nomenclature - it's a long story).

Went back to Casa Del P\_ later for [Catan](http://www.coolgames.com/mfg-cat/soc/0494-00.htm) and [videogames](http://smashbrosmelee.com/). I won my first game of Catan ever.

Happy dance!
