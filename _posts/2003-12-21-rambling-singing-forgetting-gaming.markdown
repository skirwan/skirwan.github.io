<p>I read <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a> every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I check in for non-update posts occasionally in the time between.  I know it's amazing that they're able to produce a comic on that schedule, but I also have a hard time appreciating the difficulty because, well, I can't draw.  I <i>am</i>, however, able to write, and so the fact that they have a new news post three times a week is an achievement I'm able to appreciate in a slightly-fuller-but-still-not-full fashion.</p>

<p>Which is really a long-winded way of saying that I haven't posted in a few days.</p>

<p>If anybody besides <a href="http://swcyella.blogspot.com">Her Highness</a> (and the three anonymous users I've noted in my logs) ever visited here I might even feel guilty.  Instead I just feel lazy.</p>

<p>Something, I might add, to which I am fully accustomed.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.simonandgarfunkel.com/">Simon and Garfunkel</a> are probably the most rocking sexagenarians (it sounds dirty, but it's <i>not</i>) around.  The immediate family went to a the recent concert in Sunrise (at the peculiarly-named <a href="http://www.officedepotcenter.com/">Office Depot Center</a>) and I was quite impressed.  The concert featured a 'surprise' appearance by <a href="http://www.everly.net/">the Everly brothers</a>, who are also remarkably well-preserved.</p>

<p>Really, the only disappointment is that they never played <a href="http://users.cis.net/sammy/kodacrm.htm"><i>Kodachrome</i></a>, but I guess I really have no right to expect something from Simon's solo years to show up at a reunion tour. Ah well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seahawk.org/">CSN</a> reunion last night.  As was the case during the time I actually <i>attended</i> the school, I only recognized a fraction of those present.  A fraction with a denominator rather significantly larger than its numerator, I must add.  Noticed something odd today, though; with a single exception, all my friends from HS have four-letter appellations available (I say <i>available</i> because C_ was originally introduced to me under quadra-charactered nomenclature - it's a long story).</p>

<p>Went back to Casa Del P_ later for <a href="http://www.coolgames.com/mfg-cat/soc/0494-00.htm">Catan</a> and <a href="http://smashbrosmelee.com/">videogames</a>.  I won my first game of Catan ever.</p>

<p>Happy dance!</p>
