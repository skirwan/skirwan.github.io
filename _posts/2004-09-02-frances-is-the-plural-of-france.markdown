<p><a href="http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=6AC1BB22-BF63-4A5C-8EDAF30D80824BBC&amp;title=Florida%20Orders%20Nearly%20500%2C000%20Residents%20Evacuated%20Ahead%20of%20Hurricane%20Frances">Hurricane Frances</a>.</p>

<p>We had George - pronounced something like 'Giorj' - a few years back.  We just had 'Charley' - not 'Charlie', not 'Charly', not the basic 'Charles' or the more common 'Chuck'.  And now 'Frances'.  To be followed shortly by <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml">'Gaston' and 'Hermine'</a>.</p>

<p>I must once again repeat my lament: why don't any of our storms have normal names?  Where's hurricane Frank?  Joe?  Harry?</p>

<p>Ah well.  At least this one's aimed at the other coast.  Unless <a href="http://www.fpl.com/">FPL</a> decides to throw another one of their just-because blackouts, the server shouldn't even go down this time.  I'd hope.</p>
