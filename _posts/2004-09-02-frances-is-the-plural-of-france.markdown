[Hurricane Frances](http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=6AC1BB22-BF63-4A5C-8EDAF30D80824BBC&title=Florida%20Orders%20Nearly%20500%2C000%20Residents%20Evacuated%20Ahead%20of%20Hurricane%20Frances).

We had George - pronounced something like 'Giorj' - a few years back. We just had 'Charley' - not 'Charlie', not 'Charly', not the basic 'Charles' or the more common 'Chuck'. And now 'Frances'. To be followed shortly by ['Gaston' and 'Hermine'](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml).

I must once again repeat my lament: why don't any of our storms have normal names? Where's hurricane Frank? Joe? Harry?

Ah well. At least this one's aimed at the other coast. Unless [FPL](http://www.fpl.com/) decides to throw another one of their just-because blackouts, the server shouldn't even go down this time. I'd hope.
