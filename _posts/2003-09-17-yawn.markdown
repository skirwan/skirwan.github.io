<p>Slept late today.  Slept right through Calc 2, as a matter of fact.  Good thing it's a ridiculously easy class.</p>

<p>And a silly ridiculously easy class at that.  What the hell's the point of putting extra credit questions on the test if you're not going to give me the 105% I deserve?!</p>

<p>And as long as I'm ranting, what reasonably intelligent person doesn't know how to pronounce 'Sean'?  I swear to God, I'm going to make a list of these morons and send it Sean Connery.  He'll kick their asses for me, I'm sure of it.</p>

<p>Maybe that's why I'm such a uniformly disgruntled cynical bastard - I've had people pronouncing my name wrong since the day I was born.</p>

<p>It's not Shawn, or Shaun, or Shon, or John.  It's not Shane.  It's sure as hell not Seen.  The name is Sean, morons.  If you can't wrap your head around the existence of non-English phonetic systems, then why don't you do us all a favor and wrap your heads around a telephone pole.</p>

<p>The world is full of stupid people.</p>
