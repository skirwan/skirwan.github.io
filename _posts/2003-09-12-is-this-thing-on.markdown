This site was always intended as a private exercise in narcism - at least for the moment, there's nothing here that anyone but me would be interested in.

And yet I seem to have visitors.

Greetings, unknown Mindspring user, unidentified Comcast subscriber, and unnamed patron of USLec. I wish I could be more entertaining, but that hardly seems likely.

I'm going to guess you're lost. In which case I'd advise you translate the title; it won't actually solve any problems, but denial is much more compelling in a dead language.
