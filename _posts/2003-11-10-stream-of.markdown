Office. Monday. Three-thirty-ish.

Sean. Sitting. Laptop on lap. Hot. Wintel. Figures.

AC loud. Why? Dunno. Always like that. Bugs me.

Eyes drooping. Figures. Little sleep. New Stephen King. New Dark Tower. New town, new Roland, new Breaker. Same old Flagg, same old Crimson King. Same old Father Callahan?

Wonder if Flagg/Faraday/Fannin were created? Born? Hatched? Maybe started out human?

Think Fanan's first name in Robert. Sounds right. Robert Fanan.

Total coincidence that this was Pop's name. Must be. Just fitting the pattern. Not too many other names starting with 'R'.

The fact that I question my sanity only proves I'm sane.

Still, all work, no play, not TV, no beer.

Something, something.

I want to go home, and that is the truth.
