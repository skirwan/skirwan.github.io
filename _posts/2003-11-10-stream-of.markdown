<p>Office.  Monday.  Three-thirty-ish.</p>

<p>Sean.  Sitting.  Laptop on lap.  Hot.  Wintel.  Figures.</p>

<p>AC loud.  Why?  Dunno.  Always like that.  Bugs me.</p>

<p>Eyes drooping.  Figures.  Little sleep.  New Stephen King.  New Dark Tower.  New town, new Roland, new Breaker.  Same old Flagg, same old Crimson King.  Same old Father Callahan?</p>

<p>Wonder if Flagg/Faraday/Fannin were created?  Born?  Hatched?  Maybe started out human?</p>

<p>Think Fanan's first name in Robert.  Sounds right.  Robert Fanan.</p>

<p>Total coincidence that this was Pop's name.  Must be.  Just fitting the pattern.  Not too many other names starting with 'R'.</p>

<p>The fact that I question my sanity only proves I'm sane.<br />
The fact that I question my sanity only proves I'm sane.<br />

<p>Still, all work, no play, not TV, no beer.</p>

<p>Something, something.</p>

<p>I want to go home, and that is the truth.</p>
