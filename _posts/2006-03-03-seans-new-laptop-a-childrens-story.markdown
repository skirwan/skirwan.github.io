<p>Today when Sean came home, he saw a fantabulous sight!</p>

<p><img src="http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook1.jpg" alt="The FedEx Fairy left boxes!" /></p>

<p>Sean was so happy that he did that growling-squinting thing that almost resembles a human smile!</p>

<p><img src="http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook2.jpg" alt="Either happy or preparing to bit your neck" /></p>

<p>Sean was sad, because the pictures taken by his cell phone camera are <i>very</i> lousy.  But then Sean had an idea!</p>

<p>"Hey, doesn't this new MacBook have a camera built in?" said Sean.  And sure enough, it did!</p>

<p><img src="http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook3.jpg" alt="And *crack* went the lense!" /></p>

<p>It was very cool.  It was so cool that Sean's brain began to overheat!  And his head began to melt!</p>

<p><img src="http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook4.jpg" alt="PhotoBooth is a wonderful waste of time" /></p>

<p>"These pictures are so much better than the first two!" said Sean.</p>

<p>"You're dead to me, cell phone!"</p>

<p><img src="http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook5.jpg" alt="It shall sleep with the fishes!" /></p>

<p>"Poor Mr. MacBook Pro can see everything but himself!"  noticed Sean.</p>

<p>This made Sean sad, so Sean decided to help Mr. MacBook Pro out.  Sean took Mr. MacBook Pro to the magic mirror in the enchanted hallway by the front door.</p>

<p><img src="http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook6.jpg" alt="It is a very bright screen" /></p>

<p>"Here you are, Mr. MacBook Pro!"</p>

<p>Just then, a radiation wave hit, and Sean and Mr. MacBook Pro got shot through a Wormhole!</p>

<p><img src="http://seankerwin.org/images/MacBook7.jpg" alt="I am not John Crichton" /></p>

<p>Now Sean is on a living ship full of strange alien life forms.  But that is a story for another day!</p>
