...of something funny but not too useful.

So [Her Highness](http://swcyella.blogspot.com/) was initially a bit miffed about the Carthage line at the end of my [earlier post](http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2003_12.shtml#000071). Her reasoning was that I was saying something about her that she didn't understand, and thus it was likely an insult. Sharp girl, _n'est pas_?

The real story is as follows: for a variety of reasons, far beyond the scope of this blurb, a number of Romans felt a great deal of hostility towards Carthage in the period around 200 BC. The hostility actually extended quite a ways on either side of 200 BC, but it's around 200 BC that's important here.

Right around the time period in question, Cato the Elder was a Roman statesman, a senator I think, who held a particular grudge against Carthage. And so, to ensure the issue wouldn't be forgotten, he would end every speech by saying, "_ceterum censeo Carthago delenda est_". Which, loosely translated, means, "and furthermore, I think that Carthage should be destroyed".

> Or more literally, "and furthermore, I think Carthage is {fated / destined / required / needed} to be destroyed". It's almost a sort of fulfilling-fate, doing-the-gods'-will sort of tone.  
>   
> It's kind-a like the French _exiger_ in that the concept is very clear, very simple, and very nearly impossible to cleanly translate to English.  

Anyway, Cato would _always_ end his speeches with this. He could be talking about foreign affairs or simply leading a toast - it didn't matter to him. So it makes a good funny ending to long rants that may seem too serious. It's kind-a like saying ['Burma Shave'](http://www.fiftiesweb.com/burma.htm) after a particularly dreadful piece of poetry. Not that I imagine a whole lot of people will be getting that reference either.

Anyway, now that you know, go use it in a history paper. If your teacher gets the reference, s/he will be pretty bloody impressed.
