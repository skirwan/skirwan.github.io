<p>...of something funny but not too useful.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://swcyella.blogspot.com/">Her Highness</a> was initially a bit miffed about the Carthage line at the end of my <a href="http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2003_12.shtml#000071">earlier post</a>.  Her reasoning was that I was saying something about her that she didn't understand, and thus it was likely an insult.  Sharp girl, <i>n'est pas</i>?</p>
<p>The real story is as follows: for a variety of reasons, far beyond the scope of this blurb, a number of Romans felt a great deal of hostility towards Carthage in the period around 200 BC.  The hostility actually extended quite a ways on either side of 200 BC, but it's around 200 BC that's important here.</p>
<p>Right around the time period in question, Cato the Elder was a Roman statesman, a senator I think, who held a particular grudge against Carthage.  And so, to ensure the issue wouldn't be forgotten, he would end every speech by saying, "<i>ceterum censeo Carthago delenda est</i>".  Which, loosely translated, means, "and furthermore, I think that Carthage should be destroyed".</p>
<div class="quote">Or more literally, "and furthermore, I think Carthage is {fated / destined / required / needed} to be destroyed".  It's almost a sort of fulfilling-fate, doing-the-gods'-will sort of tone.<br /><br />It's kind-a like the French <i>exiger</i> in that the concept is very clear, very simple, and very nearly impossible to cleanly translate to English.</div>
<p>Anyway, Cato would <i>always</i> end his speeches with this.  He could be talking about foreign affairs or simply leading a toast - it didn't matter to him.  So it makes a good funny ending to long rants that may seem too serious.  It's kind-a like saying <a href="http://www.fiftiesweb.com/burma.htm">'Burma Shave'</a> after a particularly dreadful piece of poetry.  Not that I imagine a whole lot of people will be getting that reference either.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that you know, go use it in a history paper.  If your teacher gets the reference, s/he will be pretty bloody impressed.</p>
