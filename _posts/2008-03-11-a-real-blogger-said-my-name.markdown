[My name on Instapundit.com](http://instapundit.com/archives2/016395.php).  

It's like I've made it or something.  

Except for my not putting a link in my email and consequently not picking up the oodles and oodles of Google juice. Which is actually a good thing, because the fan in this computer is pretty bad and there's a real possibility that an Instalanche could literally set my computer on fire. Or cause Comcast to send a hit squad.
