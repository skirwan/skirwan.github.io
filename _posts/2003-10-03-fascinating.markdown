<p>As any Matrix fan with near-perfect recall of useless information could undoubtedly tell you, Mr. Thomas Anderson, also known by the hacker alias 'Neo', worked at a company called Metacortex prior to his untimely disappearance.</p>

<p>Image my surprise at being introduced to <a href="http://www.metacortechs.com/">Metacortechs.com</a>.  And, of course, a number of <a href="http://www.underscorehosting.com/">other</a> <a href="http://www.paranormaljournal.org/">very</a> <a href="http://www.little-boxes.net/">interesting</a> <a href="http://www.metadex.net/">sites</a>.</p>

<p>For those keeping score at home, Elizabeth McConnell seems to be walking the same path as a certain Mr. Anderson, and Phillip Gairden seems to be encouraging her.  Steven Walsh is just a little bit scary, perhaps because of the somewhat odd disappearance of former CEO (?) James Avery.</p>

<p>Beth doesn't have a very secret password for her MetaDex account, but she doesn't seem to use the same one everywhere.  Damn.  On the up side, Underscore doesn't have a terribly impressive security system... working on that as we speak, it's only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Oddly, MetaDex.net seems to have ports open for Napster and Gnutella, which seems like something worth looking at more closely.</p>

<p>On the off chance someone finds this, collaboration would be welcome.</p>
