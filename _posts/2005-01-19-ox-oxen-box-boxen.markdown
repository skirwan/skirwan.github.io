So I've been watching the reruns of [Gilmore Girls](http://www.thewb.com/Shows/Show/0,7353,%7C%7C159,00.html) on cable (and I swear to God the next person to make fun of my watching Gilmore Girls will die a horrible and bloody death), and one of the running jokes in yesterday's episode was Lorelai's discovery that the plural of "cul-de-sac" is "culs-de-sac" rather than "cul-de-sacs". Which isn't much of a revelation if you know any French, but still ends up being quite funny.

Anyway, apparently I'm not the only person watching Gilmore Girls. Check out [this item](http://engadget.com/entry/1234000300028143/) from [Engadget](http://engadget.com) today.

Heh.
