<p>So I've been watching the reruns of <a href="http://www.thewb.com/Shows/Show/0,7353,%7C%7C159,00.html">Gilmore Girls</a> on cable (and I swear to God the next person to make fun of my watching Gilmore Girls will die a horrible and bloody death), and one of the running jokes in yesterday's episode was Lorelai's discovery that the plural of "cul-de-sac" is "culs-de-sac" rather than "cul-de-sacs".  Which isn't much of a revelation if you know any French, but still ends up being quite funny.</p>

<p>Anyway, apparently I'm not the only person watching Gilmore Girls.  Check out <a href="http://engadget.com/entry/1234000300028143/">this item</a> from <a href="http://engadget.com">Engadget</a> today.</p>

<p>Heh.</p>
