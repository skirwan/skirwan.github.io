I'm not going to say 'vote or die', because that's just ridiculous. I _am_ going to say that George W. Bush, for all his faults, has demonstrated a much broader willingness to put the safety of Americans first, whereas John Kerry has yet to demonstrate anything much grander than a burning yearning to be President.
