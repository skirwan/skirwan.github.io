I really enjoyed this movie. I found it thoroughly entertaining.

Then I watched it with the sound _on_, and I changed my mind entirely.

_The Day After Tomorrow_ is a mindless action movie that thinks it has a profound social message. The special effects are great, but the constant bitching about the current Presidential administration's environmental policies is a bit much for my taste. If the filmmakers had made even the slightest effort to control their venom, I might even have swallowed the agenda -- I use low-power everything, and I drive the most fuel-efficient car I can afford -- but writing the Vice President as a cartoonish caricature of Cheney was just insulting.
