The new version of [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) is out - and as has been discussed _ad nauseum_ elsewhere, it's no longer as free as once it was. It's not a big deal for me; MT 2.65 works fine for my needs. But it's somewhat dismaying to note my minimal arrangment here (two authors, four blogs, two sites) would be seventy bucks under the new plan.

On the one hand, _rah-rah capitalism_. On the other, this abrupt transition from free-for-personal-use to free-for-limited-personal-use is a bit of a bait-and-switch. Had I known that [Six Apart](http://sixapart.com/) would be going this direction, I'm fairly sure I would have strolled on down to OpenSourceVille.
