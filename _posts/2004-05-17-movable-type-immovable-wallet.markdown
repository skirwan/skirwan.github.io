<p>The new version of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> is out - and as has been discussed <i>ad nauseum</i> elsewhere, it's no longer as free as once it was.  It's not a big deal for me; MT 2.65 works fine for my needs.  But it's somewhat dismaying to note my minimal arrangment here (two authors, four blogs, two sites) would be seventy bucks under the new plan.</p>

<p>On the one hand, <i>rah-rah capitalism</i>.  On the other, this abrupt transition from free-for-personal-use to free-for-limited-personal-use is a bit of a bait-and-switch.  Had I known that <a href="http://sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> would be going this direction, I'm fairly sure I would have strolled on down to OpenSourceVille.</p>
