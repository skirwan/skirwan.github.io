<p>Just updated the site to use the latest version of <a href="http://http://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, primarily for the TypeKey authentication system - I've been having a lot of problems with comment spam.</p>

<p>Probably still bugs to be worked out.  Leave comments if you find any.</p>
