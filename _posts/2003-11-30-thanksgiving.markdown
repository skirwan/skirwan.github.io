<p>And so it ends.</p>

<p>Far too much flying, far too much driving, far too much getting-up-early.  But fun nonetheless.</p>

<p>I've decided that I need to update the <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/lovejoy/football.html">Family Football page</a> - Owen hasn't updated lately, and I suspect with the two little ones he hasn't got the time.</p>

<p>This was one of the largest turnouts we've had (41, I think?) despite a few notable absences.</p>
