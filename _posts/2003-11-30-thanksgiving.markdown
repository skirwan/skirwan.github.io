And so it ends.

Far too much flying, far too much driving, far too much getting-up-early. But fun nonetheless.

I've decided that I need to update the [Family Football page](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/lovejoy/football.html) - Owen hasn't updated lately, and I suspect with the two little ones he hasn't got the time.

This was one of the largest turnouts we've had (41, I think?) despite a few notable absences.
