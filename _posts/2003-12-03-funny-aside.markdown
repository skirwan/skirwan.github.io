I changed the page a few days back (at the same time as I added the dazzling example of my non-photogenic nature, as a matter of fact) to add little sigils at the lower-right corner of each post. There are actually two sigils there; a light gray watermark on the body itself, and a darker gray foreground image appended to the caption line. On Safari they display atop one another, giving a rather nifty shadow effect. On IE6 Win, you only get the dark one. On Mozilla you only get the light one. Pretty nifty, eh?

I'm going to pretend I planned it that way.
