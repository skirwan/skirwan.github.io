<p>Completely redid the CSS.  Looks nice in Safari and Mozilla.  Looks bad in Mac IE 5.  Haven't seen it in anything Winteloid as of yet.</p>

<p>Disabled comments and 'trackback' (whatever the hell that may be), but it's not like anybody will ever even find this site, so I can't see how that'll be a problem.</p>
