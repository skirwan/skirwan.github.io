I haven't posted anything of substance in a while. Mainly because I haven't anything of substance to say. Got bored and played with CSS for a while the other day; there's now finally a second theme for the site. It's missing a few minor niceties (the elements I use for styling quotes and code blocks are missing, for one) but on the whole it look quite nice in Safari and Mozilla derivatives. IE 5 Mac basically just puts up a window and vomits on it however. And I've yet to summon sufficient intestinal fortitude to see what the Windows IE versions do with it.

Ah well. Am I the only one periodically refreshing the [Apple homepage](http://www.apple.com/) throughout the day in hopes of [precisely timing an iTunes purchase](http://www.apple.com/itunes/100million/)? I am?
