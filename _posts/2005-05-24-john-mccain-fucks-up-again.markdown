Hey, remember that wonderful campaign-finance thing that was going to end world hunger and cure all diseases but instead just gave us the [same old Soros-funded crap in a new bag](http://www.moveonpac.org/)?

Well, the [miserable failure](http://mccain.senate.gov/) who brought us that miserable failure has done it again: a 'compromise' in which Democrats retain the 'right' to the filibuster, and the Senate finally manages to vote on three - _just three!_ - judicial candidates. Someone ought to explain to McCain that in a _compromise_, _both sides get something_! This isn't compromise, this is the lunatic-fringe-anti-democratic-tinfoil-hat-crowd winning, flat out.

A democracy requires voting, and it requires that all involved agree to abide by the outcome of the vote. Suing for a recount is not democratic. Permanently stalling to prevent the vote is not democratic. Maybe someday the democrats will spend some of their soft-money donations on something useful, and _buy a fucking clue_.
