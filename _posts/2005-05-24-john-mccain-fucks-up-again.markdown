<p>Hey, remember that wonderful campaign-finance thing that was going to end world hunger and cure all diseases but instead just gave us the <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org/">same old Soros-funded crap in a new bag</a>?</p>

<p>Well, the <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/">miserable failure</a> who brought us that miserable failure has done it again: a 'compromise' in which Democrats retain the 'right' to the filibuster, and the Senate finally manages to vote on three - <i>just three!</i> - judicial candidates.  Someone ought to explain to McCain that in a <i>compromise</i>, <i>both sides get something</i>!  This isn't compromise, this is the lunatic-fringe-anti-democratic-tinfoil-hat-crowd winning, flat out.</p>

<p>A democracy requires voting, and it requires that all involved agree to abide by the outcome of the vote.  Suing for a recount is not democratic.  Permanently stalling to prevent the vote is not democratic.  Maybe someday the democrats will spend some of their soft-money donations on something useful, and <i>buy a fucking clue</i>.</p>
