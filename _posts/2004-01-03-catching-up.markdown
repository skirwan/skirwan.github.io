Better now. Trying to catch back up with the world after a week in bed.

Which is a tough trick, because I was never really caught up with the world before. Ah well.

![](images/paintball.jpg)I went paintballing last Saturday. A remarkable sport. Really gets the adrenaline flowing. I got shot in the face. I'm struck by the close resemblance between paintball helmets and the helmet the [M.C.](http://halo.bungie.org/story/masterchief.html) wears in [Halo](http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/). Coincidence? I think... probably.

Anyway.
