<p>Better now.  Trying to catch back up with the world after a week in bed.</p>

<p>Which is a tough trick, because I was never really caught up with the world before.  Ah well.</p>

<p><img class="rightfloating" src="images/paintball.jpg" alt="" />I went paintballing last Saturday.  A remarkable sport.  Really gets the adrenaline flowing.  I got shot in the face. I'm struck by the close resemblance between paintball helmets and the helmet the <a href="http://halo.bungie.org/story/masterchief.html">M.C.</a> wears in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/">Halo</a>.  Coincidence?  I think... probably.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>
