Introducing what may well be the world's dorkiest game: [Six Degrees of Randall Flagg](flagg.shtml). Though I doubt there are more than a handful of human beings who could actually _play_ this game at a speed remotely resembling real-time, I find it amusing. I plan on creating a list of difficult or amusing solutions just as soon as I get around to it.
