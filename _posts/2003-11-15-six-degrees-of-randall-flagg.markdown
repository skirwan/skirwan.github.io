<p>Introducing what may well be the world's dorkiest game: <a href="flagg.shtml">Six Degrees of Randall Flagg</a>.  Though I doubt there are more than a handful of human beings who could actually <i>play</i> this game at a speed remotely resembling real-time, I find it amusing.  I plan on creating a list of difficult or amusing solutions just as soon as I get around to it.</p>
