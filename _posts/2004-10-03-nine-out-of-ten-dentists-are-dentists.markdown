So it seems [Newsweek](http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2004/09/01/news_weak.shtml) is [at it again](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6159637/site/newsweek/).

Of course it turns out that when you [take a look at their polling methodolgoy](http://politicalvicesquad.blogspot.com/2004/10/liberal-media-cognitive-dissonance.html), things may not be quite so cut and dry.

If I call a hundred Californian Democrats at random, I'm sure _at least_ half of them will support Kerry. He's experiencing a big 'ol bounce after the debate. You know, that debate that the [media](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6151584/) [say](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6161680/site/newsweek/) [Kerry](http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/01/debate.poll/) [won](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/Vote2004/debate_poll_040930.html) and most folks who aren't working for the media [thought](http://washingtontimes.com/national/20041001-123117-5788r.htm) [was](http://billroggio.com/archives/2004/09/presidential_de.html) [too](http://www.wonkette.com/archives/first-presidential-debate-some-quick-first-impressions-022467.php) [close](http://www.time.com/time/election2004/article/0,18471,703928,00.html)\* [to](http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/oped/knippenberg/04/debate.html) [call](http://instapundit.com/archives/018159.php). That debate.

Gee, I wonder if Newsweek's poll [passes the global test](http://transterrestrial.com/scripts/globaltest/)...

\* Read more than the headline from this link. Even though the editors at Time couldn't bring themselves to out-and-out _lie_, they still managed to spin things a good 179 degrees.
