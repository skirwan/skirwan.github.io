<p>So it seems <a href="http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/archives/2004/09/01/news_weak.shtml">Newsweek</a> is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6159637/site/newsweek/">at it again</a>.</p>

<p>Of course it turns out that when you <a href="http://politicalvicesquad.blogspot.com/2004/10/liberal-media-cognitive-dissonance.html">take a look at their polling methodolgoy</a>, things may not be quite so cut and dry.</p>

<p>If I call a hundred Californian Democrats at random, I'm sure <i>at least</i> half of them will support Kerry.  He's experiencing a big 'ol bounce after the debate.  You know, that debate that the <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6151584/">media</a> <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6161680/site/newsweek/">say</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/01/debate.poll/">Kerry</a> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/Vote2004/debate_poll_040930.html">won</a> and most folks who aren't working for the media <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/national/20041001-123117-5788r.htm">thought</a> <a href="http://billroggio.com/archives/2004/09/presidential_de.html">was</a> <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/archives/first-presidential-debate-some-quick-first-impressions-022467.php">too</a> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/election2004/article/0,18471,703928,00.html">close</a>* <a href="http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/oped/knippenberg/04/debate.html">to</a> <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/018159.php">call</a>.  That debate.</p>

<p>Gee, I wonder if Newsweek's poll <a href="http://transterrestrial.com/scripts/globaltest/">passes the global test</a>...</p>

<p>* Read more than the headline from this link.  Even though the editors at Time couldn't bring themselves to out-and-out <i>lie</i>, they still managed to spin things a good 179 degrees.</p>
