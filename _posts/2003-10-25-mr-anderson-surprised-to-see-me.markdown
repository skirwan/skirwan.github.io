Agent Smith

And now, [some website I've never heard of](http://www.tk421.net/) asks, [which sci-fi/fantasy character are you?](http://www.tk421.net/character/)

Can't say as I'm all that surprised. Mr. Anderson.

Now I just need to figure out how to overwrite other systems. The world could do with a few more of me. Or at least, _I_ could.

_I'm going to be honest with you. I hate this place. This zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it._
