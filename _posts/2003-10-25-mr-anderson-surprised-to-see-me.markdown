<p>And now, <a href="http://www.tk421.net/">some website I've never heard of</a> asks, <a href="http://www.tk421.net/character/">which sci-fi/fantasy character are you?</a></p>

<p>Can't say as I'm all that surprised.  Mr. Anderson.</p>

<p>Now I just need to figure out how to overwrite other systems.  The world could do with a few more of me.  Or at least, <i>I</i> could.</p>

<p><i>I'm going to be honest with you.  I hate this place.  This zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.</i></p>
