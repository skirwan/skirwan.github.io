For what it's worth, I retract my anger over Kerry's late concession. Election's over, we can all get along again.

> There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate without reservation, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too. Where's evil? It's that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive. It's that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly.  

\-- Kurt Vonnegut, _Mother Night_
