<p>Just installed <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Panther</a> on the server. And swapped the hard disk.</p>

<p>I'm still not sure what was causing those problems, but hopefully this will fix them.</p>

<p>Also cleaned up the configuration.  Hosting subdomains shouldn't be quite so bad of a hack, now.  I hope.</p>
