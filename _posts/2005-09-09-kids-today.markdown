I suppose it's a valid question, but that's not what caught my eye.</p>
<div class="quote">"How do the adults feel about us moving in? What if I find a Caucasian girl and decide to date her?"</div>
<p>Asks the 36-year-old black man.</p>
<p>Think about that for a minute.  The 36-year-old wonder what the adults think of him, and worries about dating a white a girl.</p>
<p>I've got to wonder, Mr. Andrew, at what point you stop worrying what the adults think and start thinking for yourself as an adult.  And I won't even bother suggesting that instead of 'deciding to date a Caucasian girl' you find a nice <i>woman</i> - whatever flavor you like - and convince <i>her</i> to date <i>you</i>.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm jumping all over a poorly-contextualized statement likely delivered extemporaneously.  But the fact that this attitude can exist - the thirty-six-year-old <i>kid</i> - seems to me to be symptomatic of a far greater problem.</p>
