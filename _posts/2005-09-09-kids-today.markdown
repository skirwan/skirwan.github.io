[Black refugees ask if Utah will really accept them.](http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/09/09/MTFH18824_2005-09-09_21-12-19_SPI974148.html)  

I suppose it's a valid question, but that's not what caught my eye.

> "How do the adults feel about us moving in? What if I find a Caucasian girl and decide to date her?"  

Asks the 36-year-old black man.

Think about that for a minute. The 36-year-old wonder what the adults think of him, and worries about dating a white a girl.

I've got to wonder, Mr. Andrew, at what point you stop worrying what the adults think and start thinking for yourself as an adult. And I won't even bother suggesting that instead of 'deciding to date a Caucasian girl' you find a nice _woman_ - whatever flavor you like - and convince _her_ to date _you_.

Yeah, I'm jumping all over a poorly-contextualized statement likely delivered extemporaneously. But the fact that this attitude can exist - the thirty-six-year-old _kid_ - seems to me to be symptomatic of a far greater problem.
