<p>Not to go starting an argument here, but…</p>

<p>Imagine a group of straight people got together and organized a ‘straight pride’ week, during which they felt everyone should celebrate heterosexual culture and recognize the important contributions straight people have made to society.</p>

<p>How would that make you feel?</p>
