<p>Ever watch basketball?  Sure you have.  Know what I don't get?  Listen to the commentators for a bit, and you'll hear things like, "and he's lost control of the basketball", or "and he shoots the basketball," or "and look at them move that basketball."</p>

<p>Why the hell don't they just call it a <i>ball</i>?  I mean, if you think they're playing with a <i>football</i>, you're probably sufficiently confused that the commentary is the least of your worries.  Likewise if you don't know what sport you're watching.</p>

<p>Think about it!  A 66% reduction in syllables!  They say that word hundreds of times a game - think how much time that is over the course of their lives.  Think how much wear and tear they could save on their poor larynxes (larynxi?  larynxen?).</p>

<p>So anyway, that's the end of my weblog post.</p>

<p><i>See what I mean?!</i>  Somebody call in the ODRDO (Office of the Department of Redundancy Department Office).</p>
