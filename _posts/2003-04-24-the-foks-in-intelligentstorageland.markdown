The foks in intelligent-storage-land are starting to realize just how much they don't know how to do on their own, I think:

> Somebody: Will we need a CD with this product?  
> Me: I'd think so, given the six megs of support software you'll need.  
> Somebody: What support software?  
> Me: The drivers.  
> Somebody: Where are those?  
> Me: Good question.

Names changed to protect the inert, of course.
