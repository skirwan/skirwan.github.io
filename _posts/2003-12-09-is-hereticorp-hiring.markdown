<p>So I'm back to being a freelance bum.</p>

<p>It's just as well, I was planning on quitting Wednesday anyway.  I'll admit to being a bit miffed about not being able to resign, though.</p>

<p>In my view, if you hire someone to do X, then they should mostly be doing X.  None of this hey-let's-call-him-an-engineer-and-then-make-him-a-fucking-courier crap.  Not that I'm bitter.</p>
