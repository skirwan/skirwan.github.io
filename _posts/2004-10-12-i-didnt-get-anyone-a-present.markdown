<p>I'd just like to wish everyone a joyous Khrushchev's Shoe Day.  As I'm sure we all know, today is the day when we join together to celebrate Nikita Khrushchev's shoe, and the infamous table-banging thereof.  It is a day of peace, a day for us to forget about what makes us different and to remember those things that make us all the same: we all wear shoes, and we all giggle a little at the thought of an angry Russian banging his on the table.</p>

<p>Happy Shoe Day, and a Joyous Octoberween.</p>
