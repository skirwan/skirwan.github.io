Most (perhaps all) rooms at my school have windows. This includes most/all of the faculty offices, and many professors have taken to displaying messages by taping things to the inside of their windows. Though this phenomenon tends to devote overmuch effort to expounding the God-awful _delicacy_ of the southwest Florida ecosystem is - at least to my taste - I really can't argue against free speech. Which is actually somewhat ironic, but oh-bloody-well.

One of the offices, which I pass on the way to class nearly every day, is owned by a teacher with obvious strong affection for the Democratic party. No surprise there; this is, after all, a college campus. Those of us who don't hug trees recreationally are the only minority without any sort of special treatment. But what really gets my goat is the that this teacher, whose identity I have thus far resisted the urge to discover, has posted in his or her window the simple statement that, "When Clinton lied, nobody died."

First of all, Vince Foster. That's all I'm going to say about that. Where there's smoke, there's usually fire, and we've got a great big plume of the grey stuff floating over Arkansas.

Secondly, Clinton ordered a US strike on Iraq in 1998, to "attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors". This attack managed to kill plenty of Iraqi soldiers and civilians, but didn't seem to phase Saddam Hussein in the least. Incidentally, this action just so happened to coincide nicely with the start of impeachment hearings against then-President Clinton. Happy accident, I suppose.

Further, Clinton ordered a US-led bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. The bombing continued for 78 days. I somehow doubt that we managed to pull that off without hitting anybody. The Serbian Orthodox Church would seem to agree with me; they [sued Clinton to stop him from bombing them again](http://www.balkanpeace.org/lan/lan09.shtml).

Anyway. When Clinton lied, nobody died? I propose a simple rebuttal: When Bush dropped bombs, we _stopped_ Saddam.
