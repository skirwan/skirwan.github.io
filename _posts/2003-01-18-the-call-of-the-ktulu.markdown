<p>I woke this morning to the sound of my phone ringing.  The area code was 612, which isn't one I recognized.  I decided there was a definite possibility that it was my boss calling from Atlanta, and elected to let it ring.  Whoever the caller was, he or she decided not to leave a message.</p>

<p>It turns out that 612 is the area code for Minneapolis, Minnesota.  So now I'm stuck with the question: who the hell do I know in Minnesota?  I'm pretty sure I don't know anybody.  It's a tough one.</p>
