<p>I'm in the process of redesigning this site.  As you may have noticed, the current design is somewhat suboptimal.  The new design is a bit cleaner, puts the posts right on the front page where I've finally recognized they belong, and is more-than-partially-derivative of <a href="http://kottke.org/">kottke.org</a> (the design is; the MT templates and CSS were designed from scratch in a clean-room environment).  The new design is still a work in progress, but you can view a preview <a href="http://hamstergeddon.dyndns.org/reloaded.shtml">here</a>.</p>
