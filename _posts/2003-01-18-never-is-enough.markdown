<p>Dilbert was funny today.  This isn't surprising or unusual in and of itself; Dilbert is often funny.  What's particularly notable about today's strip is that it seems to be about someone I work with.</p>

<p><a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2003-01-18/" title="Dilbert.com"><img src="http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/000000/00000/0000/000/18/18.strip.gif" border="0" alt="Dilbert.com" /></a></p>

<p>The only difference is that in real life, it never turns off.</p>

<p>Ever.</p>
